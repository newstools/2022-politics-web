Senzo Meyiwa: Accused persons plead not guilty 22 April 2022 Muzikawukhulelwa Sibiya, Bongani Sandiso Ntanzi, Mthobisi Prince Mncube, Mthokoziseni Maphisa and SifikuhleNkani Ntuli Sifiso, the persons being accused of the murder of Senzo Meyiwa today in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria pleaded not guilty on charges of murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, the possession of firearms without a licence and the possession of ammunition. AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit was in court to monitor the proceedings in terms of a watching brief on behalf of Ntombifuthi Meyiwa, as well as Zama and Nomalanga Meyiwa (respectively the mother and sisters of Senzo). Adv. George Baloyi, the prosecutor in the matter, in terms of section 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 51 of 1977 adduced the evidence that the State plans to lead, as well as which witnesses would be called during the course of the case. The case will resume on Monday 25 April when the State’s first witness, namely the police photographer, will be called. He is expected to give evidence regarding the photo album and sketch plan that he compiled of the house in Vosloorus where Senzo was murdered in October 2014, as well as the fact that fragments of bullets were found in the kitchen in which Senzo was shot. “Although it got off to a stuttering start, at least the trial finally started today after eight years. We are hopeful that it will, hereafter, proceed more smoothly to ensure that the Meyiwa-family, as well as society finally receive justice for this senseless murder,” says Adv. Gerrie Nel, Head of AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit. Issued by Chanté Kelder, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 22 April 2022

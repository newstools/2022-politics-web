SANEF condemns cyberbullying of City Press journalist 26 April 2022 Cyberbullying and harassment of journalists, particularly women, continues to be one of the biggest concerns faced by the media across the world, with South Africa being no exception. The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) is disgusted and infuriated by the latest incident where fans of social media influencer, Faith Nketsi, decided to abuse and send derogatory messages to City Press entertainment reporter, Julia Madibogo. The abuse came after Nketsi publicly shared Madibogo’s cellphone number with her followers on social media. This was after Madibogo contacted Nketsi, seeking her comment on the story the newspaper published regarding Nketsi’s wedding and rumoured pregnancy. We are happy and encouraged to be informed by the management at City Press that Madibogo has laid charges with the police, and they have also engaged their legal representatives to look into this matter. Cyberbullying, among other harassments of journalists, has in recent times been on the increase and should be condemned. Cyber bullying does not only put the lives of journalists in danger, but also makes it difficult for journalists to freely do their work. SANEF has always called on those affected by news stories they deem factually incorrect, to lay complaints with relevant bodies such as the Press Council and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa. These bodies have been set up to primarily address any issues South Africans may have when it comes to accuracy and ethical conduct.

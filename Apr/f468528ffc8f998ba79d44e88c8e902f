SASSA called to account for late SRD grant payments 28 April 2022 I will invite SASSA to appear before the standing committee on Social Development in order to explain the delays in processing applications for Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grants In the Western Cape. The last few weeks have brought to light disturbing reports of grant recipients struggling to access their funds, with SASSA policies forcing people to reapply under a new legislative framework. The Democratic Alliance in the Western Cape considers it imperative to resolve this situation as quickly as possible. Introduced during the height of the State of Disaster in 2020, the SRD grant provides a vital source of income to many who have faced economic hardship as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The monthly payment allows some of the most vulnerable in society to access important basic services, even as their ability to earn a living is curtailed by current economic circumstances. SASSA’s recent announcement that no further applications will be processed until covid-19 regulations have been amended thus represents the severing of a lifeline for many South Africans. DA Western Cape spokesperson for Social Development said: “Many in our province rely on the SRD grant to alleviate the economic burden of the State of Disaster and its aftermath. However, it would appear that no provision has been made for the legislative challenges brought on by the ending of the State of Disaster, and that too many beneficiaries have been forced to struggle with red tape in order to access their money. Many have not yet received their payments for April, even as the next month looms. For this reason, the legislature will be inviting SASSA  to understand how this situation will be resolved and in order to explain their approach to these challenges.” Issued by Dan Plato, DA Western Cape Spokesperson on Social Development, 28 April 2022

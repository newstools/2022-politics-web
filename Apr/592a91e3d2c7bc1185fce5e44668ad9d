EFF statement on the dramatic arrest of Adv. Malesela Teffo in the Senzo Meyiwa trial court 29 April 2022 The EFF condemns the overzealousness of the South African Police yesterday, at the Pretoria High Court for the dramatic arrest of advocate Malesela Teffo. In an unnecessary use of force and deliberate attempt at public humiliation, the Tactical Response Team of SAPS arrested Advocate Teffo immediately after court adjourned in the Senzo Meyiwa trial. It is more concerning that the warrant of arrest is reported to have been issued in January 2022, yet SAPS waited for such a sensitive moment to effect this arrest, casting doubt and aspersion on a case which has been dragging for over 7-years. All people are equal before the law and whosoever breaks the law should be arrested, however, the constitution enjoins all of us to treat each other fairly with dignity and respect at all times, the Police included. The conduct of the Police is in contempt of court and a disregard of the long overdue justice to the family of the late Bafana Bafana Captain Senzo Meyiwa and all the accused. The EFF has always warned against the thuggish conduct of excited law enforcement agencies, whose incompetence and undermining of the sacred human rights in our constitution, including the rights of the accused to dignity, knows no bounds. The EFF calls upon the prosecution authority and justice ministry to investigate this disgusting contempt of high court by SAPS and to arrest swiftly those responsible for desecration of Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela's court. The use of the Tactical Response Team to effect an arrest for contempt is not only excessive, but wasteful, especially considering the high rate of violent crime in South Africa. The EFF calls on the Bar Council, the Judicial Service Commission and Legal Practice Council to condemn this blatant act of disrespect of the judiciary in session, which was done under the disguise of a lawful arrest.

DA welcomes new Gautent Health Head 27 April 2022 The DA welcomes the appointment of Dr Nomonde Nolutshungu as the new Head of the Gauteng Health Department. This appointment by Premier David Makhura is long overdue as this key post has been filled by two acting heads since Professor Mkululi Lukhele left in October 2020 after being implicated in the PPE scandal. Dr Nolutshungu faces multiple challenges in fixing a department that is notorious for corruption scandals and poor service delivery. The rot runs so deep that Babita Deokaran, a senior health official, was gunned down last year because she was honest and opposed corruption. Nolutshungu needs to ensure that the department’s R60 billion budget is spent efficiently and effectively. This can be achieved by following the recommendations in the Auditor General’s annual reports which regularly uncover massive irregular and unauthorised spending. Another priority is filling all staff vacancies at hospitals as soon as possible, and refurbishing crumbling facilities. Many patients are suffering because of an alarming increase in surgery backlogs, and lives are lost because of failures in cancer treatment. Meanwhile, a likely 5th wave of Covid-19 cases places further strain on hospitals. I look forward to interacting with Dr Nolutshungu to counter the threats as well as highlight opportunities to ensure a decent public health service in Gauteng.

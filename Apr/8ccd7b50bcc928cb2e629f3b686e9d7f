Delayed SRD grant payments a slap in the face for desperate recipients 22 April 2022 Note to Editors: Please find an attached soundbite by Bridget Masango MP The DA has received numerous messages from distressed Social Relief of Distress grants recipients who have been let down by SASSA after the agency’s latest delay in disbursing payments. The DA condemns this delayed payment of SRD grants, it is totally unacceptable for millions of desperate beneficiaries rely on this grant to be left hanging when these funds are their only source of income. We have even received desperate phone calls from recipients saying that this grant is usually paid by the 16th of the month, but they haven't received anything as the month draws to a close. According to information obtained by the DA, SASSA is still waiting for approvals to put President Cyril Ramaphosa's announcement into action. This is totally unacceptable and indicates major government administrative failings. When the President announced the extension of the SRD, millions of unemployed and disadvantaged South Africans believed that they would be able to put food on the table, and these delays are a slap in the face. The DA calls on Lindiwe Zulu, Minister of Social Development, to honour the President's announcement by removing any and all hurdles to avert the crisis as a matter of urgency.

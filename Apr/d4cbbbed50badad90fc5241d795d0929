AfriForum calls for recognition of communities at UN 21 April 2022 The civil rights organisation AfriForum urges the United Nations (UN) to recognize the importance of communities in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The organisation submitted a written statement for the 2022 ECOSOC (United Nations Economic and Social Council) High-level Segment (HLS) taking place from 13 to 18 July. AfriForum also submitted a request to make an oral submission during this year’s event. The organisation’s submission focused on problems caused by state failure in South Africa such as crime, civil rights abuses, inadequate service delivery and corruption. However, it also advocated for a community based bottom-up approach in securing peace, prosperity and freedom in South Africa and around the world. As a registered member of ECOSOC with special consultative status since 2020, AfriForum regularly participates in UN events. “ECOSOC provides a platform for AfriForum to represent the interests of our members and the general public on the world stage. Hopefully the lessons and solutions in our submission will inspire ECOSOC to learn from South Africa’s failures and recognize the fundamental importance of communities in building a better future,” says Reiner Duvenage, Campaigns Officer for Strategy and Content at AfriForum.

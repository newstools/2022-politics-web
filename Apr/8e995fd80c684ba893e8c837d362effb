EFF notes the appointment of Moshoeshoe Monare as SABC Group Executive for news and current affairs 28 April 2022 The EFF notes the appointment of Mr. Moshoeshoe Monare as the new SABC Group Executive responsible for News and Current Affairs. This comes after the removal of former Head of News, Phatiswa Magopeni. The appointment will fill a palpable vacuum in the SABC News and Current Affairs department, which requires a day to day monitoring of affairs not only the in country, but the continent and the world. Monare comes with a much lauded history in both broadcast and print media, having spent 25-years in various editorial roles at publications such as The Star, The Sunday Times, Sunday Independent and having a stint on the boards of agencies such as the infamous Tiso Blackstar and the Media Development and Diversity Agency. He will be tasked with bringing stability to the Department and entrenching a culture of fair and impartial reporting. As the EFF we will keep a watchful eye on his progress and conduct, and caution him from falling prey to political interference, particularly from the ruling party. The SABC is a public broadcaster, and has no allegiance to those who control the levers of the state. Accordingly, Monare must ensure that the SABC covers news and current affairs without fear or favour, fairly and without attempting to sugar-coat the brutal realities of corruption, poor service delivery and inequality.

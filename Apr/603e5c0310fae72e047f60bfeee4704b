Livestock theft is out of control 19 April 2022 Livestock theft in South Africa is getting out of control and the police seems to be losing the fight to investigate it properly. This is abundantly clear from the response to a parliamentary question posed by Dr Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, to the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele. (Minister Cele's response is attached herewith.) Livestock farming is an integral part of the country’s agricultural sector and livestock theft delivers a severe blow to livestock farmers. The police's apparent inability to solve livestock theft cases means that it is out of control. According to the Minister's response, 26 923 cases of livestock theft were reported to livestock theft units between 1 April 2021 and 28 February 2022. A mere 7 800, or 28,9%, of these cases have been solved. Complaints by farmers include a lack of officers at livestock theft units as well as a shortage of vehicles and lack of expertise. Corruption also plays a significant role and there are allegations that senior police officials are themselves involved in livestock theft syndicates. The province with the greatest number of cases during the aforementioned period was KwaZulu-Natal with 7 227 reported cases, followed by the Eastern Cape with 5 533 cases. The province with the worst crime-solving rate is Limpopo, having had just 16,5% of its cases solved, followed by Gauteng with a solving rate of 16,9%. Drastic action is needed and the new Police Commissioner, Gen. Fannie Masemola, must explain what steps he will take to address the problem. Follow-up questions about the competence of livestock theft units will also be posed in Parliament. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 19 April 2022

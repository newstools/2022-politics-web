The DA demands a full investigation and the arrest of those complicit into the bogus Home Affairs office.  20 April 2022 Note to Editors: Please find an attached soundbite by Angel Khanyile MP The recent report of a bogus Home Affairs office in Hillbrow and the arrest of at least one suspect, hint to a medium- to long-term operation allegedly aided within the actual department. Some of the documents found during a police had stamps dating back to 2020. The DA thus calls for a full investigation, and the arrest and blacklisting of all officials who may have had a hand in the establishment of this ‘unofficial’ Home Affairs office allegedly run by a Zimbabwean National in his Hillbrow flat. It is crucial for the authorities to establish how the suspect sourced the documents with security features which was used to print ID, passports, and birth certificates. In several meetings with Government Printing Works (GPW) we have been assured that all papers used by GPW to print the aforementioned documents had security features and security embedded documents. Only GPW is authorised to print any of the documents provided by the department of Home Affairs. Any person who is complicit in the setting up and running of the bogus office in Hillbrow or supplying this office with official resources must face the full force of the law.

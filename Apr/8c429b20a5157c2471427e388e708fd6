ANC Caucus calls for humanitarian support following disaster in KZN and declares its 195 Parliamentary Constituency Offices as relief efforts hub  14 April 2022 The Office of the Chief Whip of the Majority, Comrade Pemmy Majodina has today, Thursday 14 April 2022, joined the ANC in directing all its ANC MPs deployed in the 195 Parliamentary Constituency Offices countrywide to lend a helping hand by donating any form of assistance that will alleviate the humanitarian crisis following the death and destruction caused by floods in KZN coastlines and the interior, as well as certain parts of the Eastern Cape. The PCOs will be collection points from Tuesday, 19 April 2022. In this regard, the ANC Chief Whip has encouraged all ANC Caucus Members, working with Provincial Conveners as well as all our PCOs and Management Committees, to become community hubs for the provision of this humanitarian support. Individual MPs and Staff will start self — collection ahead of the activation of the drop-off of items on Tuesday, 19 April 2022. ANC Caucus further extends its heartfelt condolences to families who have lost loved ones as recovery efforts are underway and wish all those injured a speedy recovery. All ANC Fieldworkers must engage with ANC MPs and relevant Management Committees and devise localised plans that can assist and use the 195 PCOs as operational centres and hubs for the relief efforts. We appeal to MPs, community Members and members of the public at large to donate any items that can assist such as non — perishable food items, blankets, clothing, child care products such as disposable nappies and any other goods that may be of use during this devastating period. All Churches that can offer any form of assistance and provide relief to affected communities are also urged to assist all over the country. The Office of the Chief Whip welcomes the visit of President Cyril Ramaphosa and his delegation to the disaster zones and commends the efforts made thus far working with the provincial leadership at all levels to help with the plight of the people.

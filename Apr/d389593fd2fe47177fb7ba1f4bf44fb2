DA calls for probe after yet another Malmesbury jailbreak  14 April 2022 Note to Editors: Please find an attached soundbite by Janho Engelbrecht MP The DA will write to Gratitude Magwanishe, the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services, to demand a full probe into the state of Malmesbury Prison after another prison escape at this facility. This is the latest in a series of similar incidents that have occurred at this facility in recent months. 69 convicts fled in June 2020, 2 escaped in February 2021, and 3 escaped today. It is evident that security at the Malmesbury Prison facility is insufficient, and this is something that we should all be concerned about. Following each of the preceding two instances, investigations into the circumstances that led to inmates escaping were initiated; nevertheless, the suggestions provided following these investigations plainly did not result in future escapes being prevented. The DA demands that problems at this correctional facility be thoroughly investigated and resolved as soon as possible. If there is something more sinister at play, involving employees or prison administration, those responsible must be held accountable for breaking the law. A porous prison facility undermines the efforts of law enforcement officers who fought tirelessly to apprehend the now-escaped criminals. This also places undue demand on law enforcement resources, which are already strained. Parliament must intervene. Issued by Janho Engelbrecht, Shadow Minister of Correctional Services, 14 April 2022

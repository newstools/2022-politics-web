Eskom confirms constructive engagements with SCOPA on new build program and loadshedding 25 April 2022 Eskom confirms having had constructive and robust engagements with the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) during its follow-up oversight visit to some of Eskom’s facilities undertaken from 20 – 22 April 2022. During their visit to Medupi, Kusile power stations and Megawatt Park, SCOPA called on Eskom to account for progress and expenditure on the new build program and exhorted Management to redouble its efforts to minimize loadshedding. Given SCOPA’s oversight role, Eskom appreciates and understands the committee’s input as a continuation of its role to safeguard the public purse and assets. Eskom was provided an opportunity to give visibility to the trade-offs we make in our daily operations while navigating between fiscal, environmental, industrial and energy security and poverty alleviation imperatives. We further noted SCOPA’s undertaking to engage key arms of government such as law enforcement and municipalities which we rely on to operate effectively, combat entrenched networks of corruption and to maintain our liquidity. Lastly, Eskom will continue to implement SCOPA’s recommendations to demonstrate the entity’s commitment to operational effectiveness and fiscal prudence and to ensure that we can deliver on our mandate.

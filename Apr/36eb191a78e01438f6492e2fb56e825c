Angelo Agrizzi matter was adjourned and transferred to High Court for a date 1 April 2022 The Palm Ridge Specialised Crimes Court deferred the former Bosasa Chief Operations Officer, Angelo Agrizzi’s fraud case to 18 May 2022. The postponement is for obtaining a high court date. Agrizzi, who has not been in court since October 2020, had initially intended to bring an application in terms of section 342A of the Criminal Procedure Act, challenging the 'unreasonable delay' in the matter. The defence has now abandoned such an application. The state has now acquired the services of an independent pulmonologist, who will assess Agrizzi and submit a report. Agrizzi stands accused for offering gratification on behalf of Bosasa to former parliamentarian Vincent Smith, in exchange for his influence, as the then chairperson of parliament’s portfolio committee on Correctional Services. Bosasa scored contracts totalling just over R1-billion from the Department of Correctional Services between 2004 and 2007.

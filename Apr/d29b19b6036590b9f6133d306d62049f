Committee Chairperson on Communications notes suspension of MDDA’s Chief Executive Officer 8 April 2022 The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Communications, Mr Boyce Maneli, has noted the suspension of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA). When the MDDA appeared before the committee to present its performance reports for the quarters two and three of the 2021/22 financial year, the committee committed to monitor developments at the agency. The committee further wishes to assure South Africans that the matter will be on top of its agenda when Parliament’s business resumes after the constituency period. The CEO was placed on precautionary suspension early this week and the agency has also acceded to her request to refer her dispute to the CCMA. “We have noted the events at MDDA and would like to assure South Africans that the committee has prioritised its engagement with the MDDA in the next term,” said Mr Maneli.

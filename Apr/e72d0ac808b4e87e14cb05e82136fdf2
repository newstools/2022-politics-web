Charlotte Maxeke Hospital CEO earns R1.7 million a year but is not held accountable for failures that hurt patients 6 March 2022 Ms Gladys Bogoshi, the CEO of the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital (CMJH), earns R1.74 million a year but is not held accountable for all the failures that hurt patients at the hospital. This information is revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Nomathemba Mokgethi in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. According to Mokgethi, Ms Bogoshi was appointed as the CEO of CMJH on 1 February 2013, and currently earns R1 739 784 a year. The key performance areas in her performance agreement are as follows: - National Health Insurance implementation - Improved patient experience - Improving clinical experience - Improved Health Education and Health Promotion - Governance and Leadership - Economic empowerment and job creation Mokgethi says that the CEO has not been held accountable for the fire at the hospital last year because the Department of Infrastructure Development is the custodian of the building and has not provided information which implicates the CEO in this matter. Mokgethi claims that “the current CEO is executing her roles and responsibilities as required.” I think that the CEO has been obviously incompetent in not fighting vigorously to ensure that her hospital was properly maintained, including adequate fire safety measures. She has been in charge of the hospital for nine years while treatment standards for patients have continued to fall. If there was effective performance monitoring she would have been fired long ago. CMJH needs a new CEO to boost staff morale and fix the many problems that cause extra suffering for patients. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 6 March 2022

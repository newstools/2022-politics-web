KZN Floods: DA calls for suspension of Eskom loadshedding in severely affected areas 12 April 2022 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Premier Sihle Zikalala and his COGTA MEC, Sipho Hlomuka, to immediately intervene and ensure the suspension of Eskom loadshedding in areas of the province severely affected by torrential rains and strong winds. KZN has taken a severe battering over the past few days, leading to loss of life and property. The DA extends its sincere condolences to those who have lost loved ones during this extremely trying time. With clean-up operations now revealing the true extent of the damage, it is clear that parts of our province are dealing with a disaster. This as major roads and bridges have washed away and homes have collapsed, leaving many destitute. Given the circumstances, the provincial government has a duty to ensure that those who have been badly affected are not put through any further misery as a result of Eskom loadshedding. Loadshedding is effected through municipalities which means that both the Premier and the MEC have the authority to ensure that the lights do not go out in hard-hit areas. This is a non-negotiable. Earlier today, the DA called for KZN to be declared a disaster area to enable the release of much needed funding and support. Tomorrow, we will be conducting oversight inspections to some of KZN’s worst-affected areas. In the interim, our public representatives are hard at work, assisting citizens wherever they can. If KZN’s provincial leadership really cares, it will take every possible step to ensure that our province’s citizens are not left in the dark in the coming days. Issued by Francois Rodgers, Leader of the DA in the KZN Legislature, 12 April 2022

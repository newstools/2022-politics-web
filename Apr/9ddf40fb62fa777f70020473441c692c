NUMSA is considering a final wage proposal in the bus passenger sector 24 April 2022 The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) met with employers in the bus passenger sector. We met as unions and parties under the auspices of the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council (SARPBAC) to discuss a proposal for a final wage agreement. Employer associations the South African Bus Employers Association (SABEA) and the Commuter Bus Employer Association (COBEA) were also present.  Last week a proposal was made which averted a national strike. We have been engaging with employers in a bid to improve what was initially proposed. We now have a final proposal which has been put on the table which we will present to members for their approval: The proposed agreement is as follows: 1. Wage increases of 6% across the board. This increase will also extend to all allowances and benefits. 2. The 6% increase will mean that the minimum rates will be raised by 6% 3. We defeated the agenda to introduce a two-tier labour market, where new workers will be denied an increase. Instead, employers agree that all new workers will be eligible for increases, even if they join after 31 March 2022. 4. We insisted on a 1-year agreement This proposal is an above inflation increase (inflation is currently at 5.7%) and we believe that the lowest paid workers will certainly benefit, especially those on minimums. We will be consulting our members until Tuesday next week with the hope of signing the deal. We will be meeting again under the auspices of SARPBAC on Thursday the 28th of April to confirm.

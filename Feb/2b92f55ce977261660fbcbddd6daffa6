DA shocked by Tembisa Hospital murder  9 February 2022 The Democratic Alliance is shocked by the murder of a nursing assistant by her partner at the Tembisa Hospital this morning. According to the Gauteng Health Department, a 30-year-old police officer entered the hospital with a state vehicle and called his 30-year-old partner to the parking lot where he shot her dead, and then turned the gun on himself. This is one more example of our violent society where people are mercilessly attacked even in hospitals and schools. Last month the deputy principal of a Tembisa school was murdered while driving out of the school gate. Emergency workers have also been attacked and robbed in Gauteng. This latest incident also highlights the scourge of Gender Based Violence, with the added twist that it is perpetrated by a police officer who should be upholding the law not breaking it. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim. Issued by Jack Bloom & Refiloe Ntsekhe, 9 February 2022

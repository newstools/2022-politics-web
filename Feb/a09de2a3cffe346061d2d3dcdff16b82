High School Jan Viljoen issue must be handled with care 15 February 2022 The FF Plus wants to caution the Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi, and the Gauteng Department of Education to handle the High School Jan Viljoen issue and allegations of racism with the utmost care, and not to go on a witch-hunt targeting a certain part of the school community and their children. The situation can only be properly assessed once all the facts have been gathered and all role players and stakeholders have had the opportunity to state their case. Lesufi and the Department must remain neutral for the sake of all learners and school communities. The FF Plus is expressing its concern about how the matter will be handled because in the past, Lesufi and his Department dealt recklessly and thoughtlessly with the High School Overvaal issue, which lead to great unrest and riots that were based on no more than lies and fraud from the Department of Education. Both the High Court and the Constitutional Court repudiated Lesufi and his Department's conduct. In a conversation on the Gauteng Legislature's Committee on Education's WhatsApp group, various ANC Members of the Provincial Legislature (MPLs) already condemned the white section of the school community. In response, the FF Plus pointed out the gross mistakes that Lesufi made with regard to the High School Overvaal incident to the MPLs and made it clear that anyone could be drawn into legal cases. It is the MPLs' duty to remain neutral and not to jump the gun by making rash judgements seeing as there could be legal implications for MPLs who make unfounded assumptions that result in negative consequences for innocent people. The FF Plus will closely monitor the investigation into the events at High School Jan Viljoen and will also check all the facts to ensure that the interests of all learners are protected.

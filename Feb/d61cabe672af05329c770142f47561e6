DA launches #StopSchoolCapture petition to oppose ANC’s new Basic Education Bill 16 February 2022 The DA has launched the #StopSchoolCapture petition urging all South Africans to oppose a proposed Bill by the ANC which seeks to stage a coup against South Africa's parents and children. If passed, the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill will usurp the powers of school governing bodies (SGBs) to decide on admissions and language policies in their communities. The Bill also seeks to give the national Department of Basic Education, led by Minister Angie Motshekga, as well as ANC cadres like Panyaza Lesufi, unfettered power to rename schools as they see fit, effectively handing them a loaded weapon to finish the long-running war against governing bodies and mother-tongue education. To join our call and say #StopSchoolCapture, the DA encourages all concerned parents and communities to stand up against this outrageous ANC Bill by signing our online petition using the following: petitions.da.org.za/p/stop-school-capture The DA will not stand by while ANC cadres take away the fundamental rights of our communities and school governing bodies, which are guaranteed by the Constitution. Issued by Bax Nodada, DA Shadow Minister of Basic Education, 16 February 2022

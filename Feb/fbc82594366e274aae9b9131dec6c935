No NW municipality should ever be a no-go area, MEC must intervene.  4 February 2022 Note to Editors: Please find the attached soundbite in English by Freddy Sonakile. The DA condemns the violent attacks at the Ditsobotla Local Municipality, the latest being on the Auditor-General's (AG) staff who were conducting statutory audits at the municipality on 27 January 2022. While we welcome the fact that the AG office has laid a criminal case in this regard, the Democratic Alliance (DA) believes that more should be done. Earlier, the Speaker of the Municipality, Mpho Lekaba, and the Acting Municipal Manager, Jonas Letlhaku, were attacked and assaulted in the precincts of the Municipality. Both laid criminal charges. Considering that this new Council is only two (2) months in office, it is a sad state of affairs. Businesses are leaving and residents unserviced while the drama and violence are ongoing. The town, which used to be one of the cleanest in the province, is now deteriorating fast. The DA will be requesting the MEC of Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs, Lenah Miga, to do a security audit of all municipalities in the province. This audit will assist in identifying security deficiencies in municipalities to deal with this rising trend of violent incidents. Municipalities must deliver services to the residents in line with their constitutional mandate. Party politics must remain in the corridors of our respective political party offices. The DA will also be monitoring the criminal cases opened to ensure justice prevails. Issued by Freddy Sonakile, DA North West Spokesperson for COGHSTA, 4 February 2022

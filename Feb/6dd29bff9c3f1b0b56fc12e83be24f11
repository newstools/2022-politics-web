Budget blow for Gauteng residents as e-Toll promise is broken  23 February 2022 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is extremely disappointed that the Minister of Finance, Enoch Godongwana has not scrapped e-Tolls in the province during his budget speech this week. This follows Minister Fikile Mbalula’s promise in 2021 that an announcement on e-tolls would be made by the minister of finance during his budget speech. Mbalula needs to explain why this did not happen and needs to commit to the scrapping of e-tolls. He can no longer string residents along and keep Gauteng citizens for the fool. e-Tolls will now continue to be a burden to our residents who are already buckling under the pressure of the high costs of basic goods and services. Furthermore, many small businesses are unable to afford the e-tolling fee each time their vehicle passes through an e-Toll gantry while delivering goods. The time for e-Tolls to be used as a tool to gain votes and to tug at the heart strings of our residents are over. Previously the DA has called on Premier David Makhura to lodge an intergovernmental dispute regarding e-Tolls in the province so that our residents can be relieved of this unwanted burden. However, this call has fallen on deaf on ears and the goal post on e-Tolls has once again been moved to the detriment of our residents in the province. The DA will continue to fight for the scrapping of e-Tolls in Gauteng. Issued by Fred Nel, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Roads and Transport, 23 February 2022

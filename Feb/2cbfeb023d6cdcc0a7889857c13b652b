Project 2024: Brett Herron moves to National Assembly while Shaun August moves to Western Cape Provincial Parliament  7 February 2022 Following a meeting of the Party's Leadership, we wish to announce that GOOD Party Secretary-General, Brett Herron, will be moving to the National Assembly (NA) after serving in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament since 2019. Mr Shaun August, GOOD's National Organiser, will be leaving the NA to take up the seat vacated by Mr Herron in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. Mr August has served in the National Assembly since 2019. Both these leaders have served the GOOD people of the Western Cape and South Africa with distinction. GOOD's Leadership has made this decision in preparation for the upcoming General Election in 2024. In just under 4 years, GOOD has garnered support all over the country and has 52 public representatives. The Party Leadership decided to make these changes to build on this success into the 2024 National Election and beyond. We wish them well in their new roles and look forward to their GOOD work.

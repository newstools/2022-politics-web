Report confirms FF Plus’s view of July 2021 unrest 8 February 2022 The report on the unrest that swept through KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng last July has confirmed what the FF Plus said about it at the time, i.e., that the country's intelligence services were caught off guard. It applies to all the intelligence services; the State Security Agency (SSA), crime intelligence as well as Military Information (MI). It comes down to the fact that these services allowed a serious threat to South Africa and its people to develop right under their noses. President Cyril Ramaphosa must take full responsibility for this. Decisive action must also be taken against those individuals who did not do their jobs properly before the unrest, and heads must roll. The consequences of faction fights within the ANC have become evident and it is against this backdrop that President Ramaphosa's statement – that he will do anything for the ANC – is a serious cause for concern. The President of South Africa is first and foremost bound to fulfil his duty to the country and its people. The unstable relationship between the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, and the National Commissioner of Police, Gen. Kehla Sitole, is also clearly reflected in these events. Everyone knows that these two do not see eye to eye and ultimately, it is the people of South Africa who pay the price, especially when it comes to ordinary crime. It cannot go on like this; the President must take action. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 8 February 2022

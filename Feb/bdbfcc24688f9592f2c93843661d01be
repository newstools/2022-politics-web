NSFAS: DA calls for feedback on ICT systems as student portal goes offline  9 February 2022 Note to Editors: Please find an attached soundbite by Chantel King MP The DA calls on NSFAS CEO, Andile Nongogo, to provide an update to the parliamentary portfolio committee on higher education on the current state of the entity’s information and communication technology (ICT) systems. On Tuesday, NSFAS informed applicants that it was “experiencing high-traffic volume” on its myNSFAS Portal and that the portal would be offline “until further notice”. For years the DA has warned that NSFAS’ ICT systems were ripping at the seams. Even recently, the Auditor – General raised concerns about NSFAS’ ICT challenges which was presented to Minister Blade Nzimande during a higher education portfolios committee meeting. This past week, students have been unable to access the myNSFAS Portal to download outstanding documentation or to lodge appeals. These ICT challenges have a domino effect as some students are unable to pay registration and accommodation fees to kickstart their academic year. NSFAS’ short-term objectives to sort out their ICT system, as presented to Parliament, included: Maintaining system stability and availability; Improving data integrity by developing and implementing a Master Data Management strategy; Reducing risks by improving maturity on information and cybersecurity; Improving ICT compliance to governance standards and policies; Improving ICT capabilities and capacity; and Developing and retaining a motivated and skilled ICT workforce. NSFAS must urgently present their progress on their short and long term objective to the higher education portfolio committee. We need to a comprehensive ICT systems assessment report highlighting its capacity, the risk it poses for disbursements in the long run and which measures are in place to address future challenges.

Government’s donation of R50 million to Cuba is a crime against the people of South Africa 3 February 2022 The ANC government's donation of R50 million to Cuba, to reportedly assist the country with "food security", is scandalous and borders on a criminal offence against the people of South Africa, especially those who are in need of food and shelter. The deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Alvin Botes, announced the donation during a meeting of the relevant parliamentary Portfolio Committee. According to Trading Economics, the unemployment rate in Cuba was 3,5% at the end of 2021, while South Africa is teetering on the edge of ruin with its highest unemployment rate ever – it currently stands at 35%, while the expanded unemployment rate is 46,6%. This means that millions of people in South Africa are living in abject poverty. Numerous schools in the country still have to make do with pit latrines; the police force's budget has been cut back while crime flourishes; and doctors working at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital are yet to be paid their full salaries this year. These are but a few examples demonstrating that South Africa is broke and finds itself sinking fast in economic quicksand due to mismanagement. For South Africa to come to the aid of another country while it needs saving itself is absolutely baffling. Equally baffling is the reason for the donation. The ANC is busy alienating itself more and more from the people of South Africa – in this case, due to its ideological ties with a very suspect ally.

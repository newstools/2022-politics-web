DA welcomes ConCourt judgment on Public Protector Inquiry 4 February 2022 Note to Editors: Please find an attached soundbite by Natasha Mazzone MP The DA welcomes the Constitutional Court judgment today in the matter of the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, challenging the rules which govern the removal of a Chapter  9 office-bearer in terms of Section 9 of the Constitution. The Court dismissed Adv Mkhwebane’s application against having a Judge serve on the independent panel that decided whether there was a prima face case against her. We have also noted the Court dismissing the limitation on the right of a Chapter 9 office-bearer to access full legal representation during a Section 194 inquiry. This judgment is a victory for the DA and our fight to restore independence in the Office of the Public Protector. We are pleased that the Section 194 Inquiry can now continue despite the continuous efforts by Mkhwebane to derail the process. The DA looks forward to make substantial contributions to the Inquiry and we trust that it will be a robust, comprehensive process in Parliament.

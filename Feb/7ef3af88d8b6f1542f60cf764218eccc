SANDF’s fleets are sitting ducks  17 February 2022 Note to Editors: Please find attached English and Afrikaans soundbites by Kobus Marais MP. The DA calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa, as commander-in-chief of South Africa’s armed forces, to urgently intervene in the growing decline of our military. We are extremely concerned that South Africa’s military capabilities have deteriorated to the point where we would be unable to launch a meaningful defense should the situation arise. In a report to the parliamentary portfolio committee on defense, Armscor revealed that the air and water fleets are falling apart to such an extent that only one of the four frigates, and none of the three submarines are serviceable. Only 46 of 217 the South African Air Force’s (SAAF) aircraft, and only 27 of the 87 helicopters are serviceable. Not to mention the multitude of unserviceable aircraft of the VIP fleet, the transport fleet and the Gripens, Rooivalk and the trainer Pilatus fleets. In fact, almost all of the equipment procured under the arms deal are impacted and most are not serviceable. South Africa’s navy and air force are nothing but sitting ducks at the moment, and there seems to be little political will to remedy this. With the country’s porous borders and the political turmoil in our neighbouring countries – the terrorism in Mozambique being particularly concerning – we cannot sit idly by and hope for things to change. Decisive action must be taken as a matter of urgency. It is time the President, the Ministers of Defence, Finance, Public Enterprises, and the Chiefs of all our armed forces intervene to stop the near total destruction of our military prime mission equipment.

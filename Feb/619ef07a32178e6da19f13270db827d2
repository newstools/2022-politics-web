DIRCO’s electricity account is up-to-date 10 February 2022 The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) has noted with concern the media reports that it, together with Foreign Missions in South Africa and other government departments owe the City of Tshwane billions of rands due to unpaid electricity accounts. This is despite several attempts by DIRCO to reach out to the City of Tshwane to provide copies of these outstanding invoices seemingly owed by DIRCO as well as by Foreign Missions. The City of Tshwane responded in writing on Monday, 7 February 2022, confirming that the DIRCO accounts to the city are current and up-to-date, with no outstanding payments. DIRCO has also been liaising with the City of Tshwane continuously to refer any outstanding payments by Foreign Missions to DIRCO to enable DIRCO to engage the Foreign Missions. In several cases, disputes were lodged but despite the accounts being disputed and proof of payment having been sent to the City of Tshwane, the municipality has nevertheless gone ahead and disconnected power erroneously. In some instances, Foreign Missions are indeed in arrears but have made the necessary arrangements to settle the accounts. DIRCO has requested the City of Tshwane to retract the various media statements that cast aspersions on DIRCO as well as Foreign Missions who fall under the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act, No 37 of 2001. DIRCO has also requested meetings with the City of Tshwane to discuss the above statements and the perceptions that are being created that DIRCO and Foreign Missions have outstanding debt but has not been able to secure a meeting with the Executive Mayor and the MMC for Finance to discuss the matter.

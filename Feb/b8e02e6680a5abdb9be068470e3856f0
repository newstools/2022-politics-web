How does R20 million in equitable share handed to the Mamusa Local Municipality disappear within 24 hours? This municipality must be declared a crime scene! Following these allegations that came to light during a Portfolio Committee of Cooperate Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs (COGHSTA) today in the Legislature, the DA will write to the MEC of Community Safety and Transport Management, Sello Lehari, requesting that he do an urgent unannounced provincial audit of scholar transport contracts. Allegedly, R20 million in equitable share from the Provincial Treasury handed to the Municipality was depleted the same day (21 December 2021), it was revealed in the meeting during which the Speaker, O.E.

Among others, the following allegations were made: The Municipality made payments to attorneys while they did not appear on the database of attorneys utilised by the municipality; R25 million was collected in terms of rates but was never paid into the municipal account; A Woolworths card was procured, which debited amounts ranging from R90 000 monthly; Instalments for life policies of individuals was debited from the municipality's bank account. The DA will today write to the President and the Head of SIU in the North West to authorise an SIU proclamation on the affairs of the Mamusa Local Municipality. All financial irregularities must be investigated urgently. The DA will keep a close eye on these investigations and consequence management. We will leave no stone unturned until all the responsible people are taken to task. Issued by Freddy Sonakile, DA MPL North West Provincial Legislature, 15 February 2022

Mashaba to step back as City of Johannesburg Councillor 31 January 2022 Yesterday I issued a letter of resignation as a Councillor to the Speaker of the City of Johannesburg effective 28 February 2022. Following the establishment of the coalition governments in Gauteng after the 2021 local government elections, I took the approach overseeing the first few months with a view to getting ActionSA set in the council. I am very pleased to see the calibre of individuals that we have put forward as Councillors, Members of the Mayoral Committee (MMCs) and Section 79 Committee Chairpersons. Now that ActionSA’s caucus is settled and our MMCs are actively pursuing programmes of service delivery in Johannesburg, it is time for me to step back and allow someone else the opportunity to gain this critical local government experience. I have consulted my caucus and the Senate of ActionSA and there is agreement that my time must be spent leading the campaign to grow ActionSA into all 9 provinces and to mount the challenge to the ANC in 2024. The important work of expanding ActionSA will require my constant travelling to setup structures across the country and my Council seat should be filled by someone who is fully available to the needs of the residents of Johannesburg. I assure the residents of Johannesburg that I remain a resident myself and deeply invested in the ability of the multi-party coalition to deliver effectively to all communities. As the President of ActionSA, I will apply myself in the multi-party coalition to ensure stable and effective government that places the needs of residents first. Issued by Herman Mashaba, President, ActionSA, 31 January 2022

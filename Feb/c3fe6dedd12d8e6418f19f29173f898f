Tshwane Multi-party coalition votes in favour of the adjustment budget 28 February 2022 The Tshwane Multi-party coalition voted in favour of the Adjustment Budget that was tabled today in the Tshwane Council. As a multi-party coalition, we are proud of the good work done by the coalition government, the Mayor, administration and MMCs for all departments, in putting together this first adjustment budget of the new term after the election. This budget will prioritise savings towards core service delivery services so we accelerate the maintenance of critical infrastructure in water and electricity, fill potholes, repair streetlights, and provide comprehensive urban management. This budget is not affiliated to any specific political party and its manifesto points, but rather a budget that is focused on all residents of Tshwane. The multi-party coalition will continue to engage in robust discussions and negotiations to ensure that the residents of Tshwane are prioritized at all times and at the centre of any decision making within the city. As a multi-party coalition, we are committed to strong and stable governance in Tshwane which operates in the spirit of our coalition agreement and we uphold that Service Delivery Priorities are coalition priorities and it is in this spirit that the Adjustment Budget was prepared.

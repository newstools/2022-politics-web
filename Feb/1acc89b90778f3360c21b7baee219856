DA rejects RAF’s attempts to hide audit report 13 February 2022 The DA notes the Road Accident Fund’s (RAF) attempt to block the Auditor-General of South Africa (AG) from making its annual audit report public. The RAF filed an urgent application with the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to stop the AG from releasing its report and tabling it in Parliament. Not only does the RAF want the AG to pay for all costs should they oppose this ridiculous application, it also wants the application to set aside the findings of the report to be heard at a later date. Alternatively, the RAF wants the AG’s “declaration of invalidity” to be suspended for 6 months so that they can “meaningfully engage with the applicant to remedy the defect”. The RAF seems to be trying to dodge accountability. The Fund knows no end to its financial woes. According to reports, court proceedings revealed the audit’s conclusion that the RAF’s liabilities exceeded R361 billion. The RAF’s contention that their liabilities are merely R30 billion does not engender trust. Whether it's R300 billion or R30 billion, the fact remains that the RAF is a sinking ship. And now it’s attempting to muzzle the AG. What is the Fund trying to hide? Submitting financial statements is a statutory obligation, and the DA will do everything to ensure the release and tabling of the audit report to Parliament. We will not allow institutions like the RAF to undermine the essence of our democracy and constitutional design.

DA gains as ANC continue on a slippery decline in eThekwini  3 February 2022 The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal is pleased with the steady pace of growth it showed in yesterday’s by-election in Ward 101 in eThekwini. The DA grew from 13.97% of the votes to 22.03%. This result is very positive and significant for the DA considering how diverse the ward is. It is also testament to the hard work out candidate, Siboniso Sibisi, public representatives and activists put in into achieving this result. The ANC continues on a slippery decline in eThekwini. Their internal factions and battles and disgruntled voters are showing with the decline in votes. The DA gain is an indication of things to come in this province as the party will position itself as the kingmaker in the province in the 2024 provincial elections.

DA welcomes departure of Sitole, now Cele must go to save SAPS 26 February 2022 Note to Editors: Please find attached a soundbite by Andrew Whitfield MP. The DA welcomes the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to terminate the employment of National Police Commissioner, General Khehla Sitole. Recently the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a High Court judgment dismissing Sitole’s appeal “that he and two other members of top police management had breached their duties”. Clearly it was time for Sithole to go, however, the details of this dismissal is scant and the public deserves to know whether a golden handshake was given. While the Sithole’s removal is welcomed, Police Minister Bheki Cele must follow suit if the President is serious about starting the hard work of rebuilding trust and credibility in the SAPS. The tit-for-tat political spat between General Sithole and Minister Cele has rendered the SAPS ungovernable. A complete overhaul at the very top is necessary to undo the damage caused by both men.

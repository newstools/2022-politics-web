Rolling blackouts: DA to request Commission of Inquiry into Eskom 3 February 2022 Note to Editors: Please find an attached soundbite by Ghaleb Cachalia MP The DA will write to President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, requesting an urgent Commission of Inquiry into Eskom and the issue of electricity generation and supply. Eskom this week announced Stage 2 rolling blackouts. This follows on the utility’s CEO, Andre de Ruyter, warning that the road to operational recovery and sustainability will be long and hard. It also comes after the country exited one of its most intensive periods of loadshedding in November last year. De Ruyter promised greater transparency in future on both the state and performance of the power system given the likelihood that the risk of disruption will persist for the coming three to four years. In view of these ongoing challenges – financial, operational and criminal – which impact lives, livelihoods, businesses and the general state of the economy in an unconscionable manner, it is time to take serious action. The time has come to rip the band aid off this festering sore and implement the recommendations of tried and trusted experts – not cadre deployees or political appointments. Any failure to act with urgency will continue to imperil the very lifeblood of the economy. Issued by Ghaleb Cachalia, DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, 3 February 2022

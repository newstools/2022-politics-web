Minister Gungubele and Statistician-General must account for haphazard start to Census The DA will write to the chairperson of the parliamentary portfolio committee on Public Service and Administration Tyotyo James, to request that he invites the Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele, and the Statistician-General, Risenga Maluleke, to account for the continued difficulties that have plagued this year’s Census. There has been numerous reports that the 2022 Census has been plagued by a variety of logistical obstacles; including recruitment issues, vehicle delivery concerns, and challenges with tablets. All of these issues have hampered Census fieldwork and caused the online registration time to be extended. It appears that StatsSA’s processes are in complete disarray. This is a serious indictment on the entity and an indication of their inability to successfully organise and execute a once-in-a-decade exercise. While we understand the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, the reality is that the Census is counted every ten years. StatsSA had over a decade to deliver a Census free of some of the basic logistical struggles it is currently experiencing. For planning at all levels of government and society, accurate census data is essential. We cannot allow a situation where the only source of community-level data collection, is marred by mishaps that could’ve been prevented through proper planning. The DA is concerned that these problems and delays have a potential to cast doubt on the integrity of the entire process. Therefore, to regain the trust of the South African people, Minister Gungubele and Statistician-General Maluleke must inform Parliament of the measures that have been put in place to avoid any further disruptions or delays.

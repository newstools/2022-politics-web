AfriForum takes government to court regarding Cuba donation 25 February 2022 The civil rights organisation AfriForum will approach the courts to obtain an urgent interdict to prevent government to pay an irrational and illegal donation of R50 million to the Cuban Government. The application also encloses a review application to overturn the decision to donate the money to Cuba. AfriForum earlier this month demanded in a lawyer’s letter to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation a written explanation and reasons for the announcement that government wants to make this massive donation to Cuba. AfriForum insisted that no funds be transferred to Cuba since no reasons for this decision have been communicated to the public. The organisation also demanded an explanation of where the money for this donation comes from and how it can be justified in South Africa’s current socio-economic context. The government responded on AfriForum’s letter, but the organisation is not satisfied with the reasons provided and will therefor proceed with legal action. The decision was made without any parliamentary review and without complying with the Public Finance Management Act. “In the current socio-economic conditions, it is outrageous to donate such a huge amount to another country. In fact, it is an absolute insult to the citizens of the country,” says Reiner Duvenage, Campaigns Officer for Strategy and Content at AfriForum.

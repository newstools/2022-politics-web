Government Gazette inaccessible for months on end  17 February 2022 Note to Editors: Please find attached soundbite by Angel Khanyile MP. The DA will write to the Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, to demand that he immediately restores the website of the Government Gazette and ensure that the Green Gazette is updated as a matter of urgency. The Government Printing Works (GPW) website has not functioned for some time – either not availing the Gazettes online, or not allowing access to the website at all. And the Green Gazette has not been updated since 28 January 2022. It is simply shocking that government would allow this to happen. The Gazette needs to be easily accessible to ensure that all citizens know the laws of the country and make informed decisions regarding their conduct. This failure by government to ensure that South Africans are kept informed damages the very heart of the relationship between State and citizen. It begs the question of whether government was even aware that the website was down, and if so, why they did not inform the public? It is disgraceful that the ANC government cannot even maintain a simple website. How are we to trust them to implement all their vast SONA promises and end corruption?

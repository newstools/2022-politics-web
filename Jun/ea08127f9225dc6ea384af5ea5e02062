COSATU Limpopo statement on the racist assault incident in Groblersdal 20 June 2022 The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) in Limpopo is flabbergasted and outraged at the racist assault of a young Kopano Makweng by a 50 years old white male in Groblersdal. The incident happened on the 15th June 2022 at the vicinity of Game centre in Groblersdal. COSATU wishes to thank the African National Congress in the Sekhukhune region and people of Groblersdal for responding promptly in their large numbers to demand “Justice for Kopano Makweng”. We are making a call to the justice system to be harsh on perpetrators of racism to send out a clear message that our democratic state would not tolerate racial intolerance and hate crime in general. Concurrently, government should fast track the process of finalizing the Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill in to law to provide for the prosecution and sentencing of those who commit such offences. The Federation is extremely disturbed as this is not the first such racist incidents happening in the areas of Groblersdal. COSATU in Limpopo will be joining her alliance partners, civil society and ordinary citizens to demand a harsher sentence against the suspect when he appears in court on the 24th June 2022. However, it is our firm view that beyond this case, COSATU and her alliance partners should embark on a more focused and aggressive campaign against racism in Groblersdal and other areas in the province where such hate crimes are prevalent in communities and workplaces. The Federation will communicate more details once plans are ready for a Provincial Anti-Racism Day. Issued by Gerald Mkhomazi Twala, Provincial Secretary, COSATU Limpopo, 20 June 2022

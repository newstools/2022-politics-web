NUM and NUMSA condemn Fin24 for publishing fake news 30 June 2022 The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and the National Union of Mineworkers has noted a report by Fin24 which claims that workers at Eskom have rejected the wage proposal. We want to distance ourselves from this article. It is false and misleading and does not represent the position of the unions at all. NUMSA and NUM will be engaging Eskom in the Central Bargaining Forum on Friday 1 July 2022 regarding the proposal which Eskom has tabled. Any reports or claims in the media suggesting that we have either accepted or rejected an offer at Eskom are false. We call on media houses to be responsible in their reporting. When they publish fake news it can have a very detrimental impact on the negotiations process. Issued by William Mabapa on behalf of NUM and NUMSA, 30 June 2022

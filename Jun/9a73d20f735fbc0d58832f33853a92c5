DA welcomes Gupta arrests 6 June 2022 Find attached a soundbite by Siviwe Gwarube MP, DA National Spokesperson. The DA notes reports of the the arrests of the State Capture kingpins, Atul and Rajesh Gupta in Dubai. We hope that this is indeed the beginning of arrests and prosecution of those who have - locally and abroad - looted our country for years and are directly responsible for the hardships that millions of South Africans face today. The DA has noted the confirmation by the Department of Justice and we look forward to more information regarding the arrests and the process that will be followed after these arrests. It is of absolute importance that there is transparency on this matter. As President Cyril Ramaphosa faces serious questions about the dubious theft of millions of rands of cash from his farm in Limpopo, it is important that our law enforcement agencies are impartial and thorough. We will monitor this matter closely. Issued by Siviwe Gwarube, DA National Spokesperson, 7 June 2022

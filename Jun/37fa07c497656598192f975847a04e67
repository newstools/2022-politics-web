FF Plus concerned about low success rate of prosecution of farm attack cases 31 May 2022 The FF Plus is concerned about the low success rate of the prosecution (30%) of cases related to farm attacks. In reply to a parliamentary question by the FF Plus in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, confirmed that only 632 suspects out of 1 904 were successfully prosecuted between 2013 and 2018. A prosecution rate of 30% for offences that pose a material risk to the agricultural sector and, consequently, also the country's food security is not at all acceptable. The FF Plus is once again calling on the authorities to do everything in their power to combat this evil and protect farming communities.  ***  Statement issued by Fanie du Toit, FF Plus MP in NCOP (North West), 31 May 2022

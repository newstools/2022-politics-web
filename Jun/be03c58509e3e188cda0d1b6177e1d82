ANC statement on the arrest of Rajesh and Atul Gupta 7 June 2022 The African National Congress notes and welcomes the arrests of Messrs Rajesh and Atul Gupta by law enforcement authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We call on law enforcement authorities in South Africa and the UAE to expedite the extradition of Messrs Gupta to South Africa so that the charges against them can be adjudicated by a court of law to determine their guilt or innocence. The ANC reiterates its support for the work of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, headed by Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. We further reiterate our call to government and all other relevant institutions in society to act on the Commission's findings and recommendations. The latest developments underscore the commitment of the ANC-led government to rigorously root out all forms of corruption including, tender rigging, fraud, bribery and nepotism in all state institutions and the private sector.

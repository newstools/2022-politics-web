NPA confirms ‘nolle prosequi’ certificate issued to Mr Zuma 7 June 2022 The National Prosecuting Authority can confirm that the Director of Public Prosecutions in KZN has issued Mr Zuma with a nolle prosequi certificate. A nolle prosequi certificate is issued when the prosecuting authority has declined to prosecute in a particular case to a party that has an interest to pursue private prosecution. This follows a request from Mr Zuma's lawyers, after the DPP had declined to prosecute Adv Billy Downer SC due to insufficiency of evidence. The NPA agrees with the DPP that the charges laid against Adv Downer are baseless and cannot be sustained, hence her decision not to prosecute him. Adv Downer has the NPA’s full support and will continue to lead the prosecution team against Mr Zuma and Thales. Mr Zuma has the right to pursue a private prosecution and due process should be followed. Adv Downer will of course defend himself in terms of the various legal remedies available to him. The NPA will support Adv Downer in defending himself against what we consider to be an abusive private prosecution. As the NPA progresses with prosecutions of corruption and other serious economic crimes, particularly against the rich and the powerful, we expect that there will be attacks against NPA staff, in an attempt to evade justice. We will not be deterred by such attacks. Adv Downer remains focussed in ensuring that the trial against Mr Zuma and Thales resumes on 15 August 2022.

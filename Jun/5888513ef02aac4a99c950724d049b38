DA calls on Home Affairs to account over ‘major system errors’ in WC  30 June 2022 Attention broadcasters: Find English audio clip from MPP Ricardo Mackenzie attached. I have requested the Chairperson of the Provincial Legislature’s Standing Committee on Premier and Constitutional Matters to invite the Western Cape Home Affairs Executive for a briefing on the ongoing systems failures at Home Affairs offices in the province. Over the past three days, I have received numerous complaints from residents in Mitchells Plain regarding “major problems” with the Home Affairs system being offline. Of particular concern is the impact of these continued system failures on the most vulnerable members of our society. I received distressed calls from community members such as Mr Mogamat Shafiek Adams from Woodlands, Mitchells Plain who is physically disabled and had to pay for transport effectively four times due to Home Affairs being offline and a “system error”. Mr Adams was attempting to apply for an ID to access his disability grant. There were at least 3 other persons with disabilities that experienced similar challenges. The DA has for years been calling on Minister Aaron Motsoaledi to fix the challenges within Home Affairs. These challenges have now escalated to a breaking point that have major knock-on effects for all spheres of society.

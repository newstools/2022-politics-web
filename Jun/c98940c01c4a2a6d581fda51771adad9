Gauteng ANC’s elective conference results show that it’s time for a DA-led government in the province 27 June 2022 The elevation of the divisive and corruption-accused Panyaza Lesufi to the ANC’s presumptive Gauteng Premier Candidate for 2024 confirms the urgency of replacing the ANC with a DA-led government in the province. Lesufi is not a leader, and our residents are in dire need of a leader who has the best interests of the province at heart. He has a long record of dividing and scapegoating the people of Gauteng for his litany of failures as the MEC for Education. Furthermore, Lesufi also faces many unanswered questions about the corruption of the R450 million tender on the decontamination of schools during the Covid-19 pandemic, of thus plunging Gauteng into decline. This makes him part and parcel of the problem. Instead of being further divided and failed by an ANC-led government, our residents deserve a new government that will unite and serve in the best interest of the province. It is time that our residents use their vote in the upcoming 2024 elections to stop the corrupt ANC and put in place a government that will only act in the best interests of the residents it serves. Where the DA governs in the various Gauteng municipalities, we are already demonstrating that we are committed to ensuring that basic services are delivered unhindered and that our taxpayers’ money is used to uplift the communities they serve.

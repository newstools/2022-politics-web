Ramaphosa’s silence about farm theft raises many questions 7 June 2022 President Cyril Ramaphosa must provide answers to the many questions surrounding the theft that occurred at his farm in Limpopo in 2020. If the President has nothing to hide, then there is no reason to keep silent about what happened. One of the most burning questions relates to the provisions of the FICA law that imposes a restriction on the amount of cash that one may keep at their private residence. If this law was violated, it would constitute an offence, and the President must explain. And with regard to foreign currency control, there is a specific time period in which foreign currency must be exchanged for domestic Rand. According to media reports, it seems that President Ramaphosa failed to do so. He must, furthermore, state whether the South African Revenue Service (SARS) was aware of the money that was apparently stolen from his house. It does not help if the President declares that he did not steal any tax money. It does not answer the question. The question is whether he obeyed the country's laws. As President, he is supposed to set a good example of adhering to the country's laws. If he, however, violated these laws, an offence was committed and action must be taken. The FF Plus concurs with other political parties that both SARS and the Reserve Bank must also investigate the matter. It must be determined whether the President acted within his powers and functions as well as within the constraints of the law. If not, he must be prosecuted just like any other citizen.

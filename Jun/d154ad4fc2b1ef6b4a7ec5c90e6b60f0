PETER DE VILLIERS RESIGNS FROM COUNCIL BUT REMAINS A MEMBER OF GOOD 1 June 2022 The GOOD leadership has received and accepted the resignation of Peter de Villiers as a GOOD councillor in the Drakenstein Municipality and are pleased that he remains a member of GOOD. Coach, as he is affectionately known, led GOOD's campaign in the Drakenstein Municipality as our Mayoral Candidate in the 2021 Local Government Elections in November last year where GOOD obtained 4 seats in that Council. Coach has resigned to focus on other endeavours and to spend more time with his family since the passing of his wife earlier this year. Coach remains steadfastly committed to the pursuit of social justice and we hope to see his return back to public office. He will continue to work with us to champion the projects he launched to improve access to sports and recreation facilities in Paarl. For the time being we wish him all the best in his future endeavours and look forward to our continued work with him as a valued member of GOOD.

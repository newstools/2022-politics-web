MEDIA STATEMENT — BY ARTHUR FRASER 01 June 2022 Today I have taken the unprecedented step to lay criminal charges against His Excellency, the President of the Republic of South Africa, Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa ("the President"). The details of the charges and the supporting evidence, including photographs, bank accounts, video footage and names are contained in my statement filed with the Rosebank Police Station. The charges emanate from the theft of millions of US dollars, (in excess of four million US dollars) concealed within the premises of the President's Phala Phala farm in Waterberg, Limpopo, by criminals who were colluding with his domestic worker. They also include defeating the ends of justice, kidnapping of suspects, their interrogation on his property and bribery. The President concealed the crime from the South African Police Service and/or South African Revenue Service ("SARS") and thereafter paid the culprits for their silence. The evidence I provide shows that the said burglary took place on 9 February 2020. This conduct of the President and those involved constitutes a breach of, inter alia, the Prevention of Organized Crime Act, No. 121 of 1998 ("POCA") and the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act No. 12 of 2004 ("the Corruption Act"). I trust that the police and the prosecuting authorities will investigate this matter without fear or favour. I also trust that the President will take the nation into his confidence and accept or deny that the events I describe in my affidavit occurred on his property. Signed Arthur Fraser

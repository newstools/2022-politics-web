DA welcomes sentencing of teacher who committed voter fraud 14 June 2022 The DA welcomes the sentencing of a Durban based teacher today after pleading guilty to contravening the Local Government: Municipal Electoral Act of 2000. She was the presiding officer at a voting station during the 2021 Municipal Elections. She cast 24 votes, 12 for the municipal elections and 12 for ward elections and put them in relevant boxes. She was sentenced to three years correctional supervision and four years imprisonment wholly suspended for three years. The DA had on numerous occasions questioned whether the IEC conducts free and fair elections. This judgment is a clear indication that all teachers must not be allowed to be IEC employees during elections. In a country with such a high rate of unemployment, such employment opportunities should be given to unemployed individuals. The DA trust this judgment will send a strong message to everyone who contravenes the Local Government: Municipal Electoral Act of 2000 that they will punished for transgressions. Issued by Angel Khanyile, DA Shadow Minister of Home Affairs, 14 June 2022

DA CONDEMNS SUSPENSION OF DOCTOR WHO EXPOSED CONDITIONS AT RAHIMA MOOSA HOSPITAL The Democratic Alliance condemns the suspension of Dr Tim De Maayer who wrote an open letter last month exposing the terrible conditions of patients at the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital. He has been accused of serious misconduct and is not allowed on hospital property because he may “endanger patients” or “interfere with witnesses” or “reoffend”. It is utterly appalling that this dedicated doctor is victimised for standing up for the children who die needlessly because of shortage of staff and equipment. The person who should be suspended is the hospital’s CEO Dr Nozuko Mkabayi, who has spent many days working from home instead of fixing the crisis at the hospital where pregnant women were recently found sleeping on the floor. Gauteng Health MEC Nomathemba Mokgethi needs to intervene urgently to reinstate Dr De Maayer who deserves praise rather than punishment. I have signed this petition to withdraw his suspension at https://chng.it/ycwynN4p and I urge everyone else to sign it as well. Statement by Jack Bloom MPL DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 10 June 2022

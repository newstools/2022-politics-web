The nation woke up to this disturbing news and the piercing cries of distraught parents, who had to identify the lifeless bodies of their children on the floor of a tavern. As things stand, we are Eft with no clear answers as to what caused this untimely loss of life. The EFF weeps with the parents. siblings. friends, and the community of East London, which has been befallen by such a disturbing and large-scale loss of young lives. We urge the government to ease the pain of those who have lost their children, by providing all necessary logistical support, in order to identify the cause of death, bury the children and assist families in identifying the bodies of those children whom are yet to be claimed by families. This is truly a national tragedy, and we wish that these young souls who have been taken so painfully and abruptly, rest in perfect and eternal peace.

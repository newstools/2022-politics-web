KZN flood funding: ANC are the stars in their very own circus 14 June 2022 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Premier, Sihle Zikalala, to provide a full public explanation regarding R1 billion in relief funding – from National Treasury – which remains elusive two months after devastating floods hit the province. The call comes after the Premier this week hit back at Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, following claims that National Treasury had not released funding after the province failed to submit valid applications. According to Premier Zikalala, the full documents have been submitted to national departments dealing with disaster management. While the ANC are the stars in their very own circus, it is the people of KZN who are suffering. It is estimated that R25 billion is needed to rebuild KZN. It is untenable that while there is such a desperate need to fix our broken province, the ANC is squabbling about paperwork. KZN is going to take years to recover, even with the reprioritisation of existing provincial budgets – a move which is set to create further negative consequences when it comes to service delivery. Today, two months after the floods, thousands are still living in community halls, citizens have been left to fix their own roads and NGOs have been forced to do the job of government. This is clear evidence of just how incompetent and uncaring this ANC government is. The DA expects the Premier to answer to the people of KZN. He must tell them what is going on and when this when this critical aid will finally arrive.

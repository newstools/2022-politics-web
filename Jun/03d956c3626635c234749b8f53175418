DA welcomes more members of the PA 3 June 2022 The DA in Witzenberg welcomed three more prominent members of the Patriotic Alliance (PA) earlier this week. DA Constituency Head in Witzenberg, Wendy Kaizer-Philander, says that people can see the DA difference in rural areas and then come to the realization that the DA is the only party that really brings change in people's lives. The new members, Neville Jansen, Daniel Malan and Petrus Janses, have therefore decided that they want to be part of a team that will actively take Witzenberg forward. Tertuis Simmers, DA Leader in the Western Cape, says that it is very ironic that we had to receive the new members in the dark, during load shedding. "It was a concrete example of why more people prefer the DA. We offer the only alternative against the ANC and its incompetent state institutions. In Stellenbosch and Cape Town, voters can see that the DA is making significant progress where we govern and that we work hard to free the people from the burden of ANC institutions like Eskom.” Simmers and Kaizer-Philander warmly welcomed the members and also thanked the local DA leadership for the good work they are doing to promote the DA in the area. Simmers further claims that “the DA is a diverse party that will welcome anyone who shares our values, but also takes the bigger picture into account. And that is that the DA wants to make South Africa a better place for everyone.” "We look forward to working with our new members, and those who will be joining in future. The DA is the only party with a clean record of service delivery and together we will make Witzenberg even better,” Philander concluded.

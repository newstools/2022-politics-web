More killings in Khayelitsha, Cele must go 9 June 2022 Note to Editors: Please find English soundbite here and Afrikaans here. After the latest mass shooting in Khayelitsha, the DA Provincial Leader in the Western Cape, Tertuis Simmers said, “we cannot allow ourselves to become desensitized to violent crime in South Africa – more and more people are being killed and we must keep the pressure on those who are responsible for keeping us safe.” Policing in the Western Cape continues to be under-resourced and under-deployed, and Minister Cele is not lifting a finger to address this. He continues to ignore the desperate call of our people. How many mass killings need to happen before the Minister takes action? “I say there have been enough killings in Khayelitsha, enough killings in Nyanga, in Mannenburg, in Grassy Park. Minister Cele has failed us and he will continue to fail us. It is time for him to step down!” Issued by Tertuis Simmers, DA Provincial Leader, Western Cape, 9 June 2022

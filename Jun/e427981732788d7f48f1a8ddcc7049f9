Mr Ismail Monoiat appointed as National Treasury acting DG 8 June 2022 The Minister of Finance, Mr Enoch Godongwana, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr Ismail Momoniat as the Acting Director-General of the National Treasury from 8 June 2022. Mr Momoniat brings a wealth of experience to the position, having served National Treasury with dedication for 27 years, of which 22 years have been instrumental in leadership of the organisation as a Deputy Director-General. I am confident that Mr Momoniat will keep a steady hand on the organisation, steering the department to meet our strategic agenda while ensuring continuity and stability. Mr Momoniat’s focus at the National Treasury has been on formulating and designing the policy and legislative framework for the fiscal and financial governance and accountability system for the public sector, the intergovernmental fiscal framework, and the tax and financial regulatory system. This included driving the foundational financial and fiscal legislation to give effect to our 1996 Constitution, to reverse the legacy of the racist Apartheid state. This included the development and enactment of the Public Finance Management Act which promoted good financial governance in the public sector and outlined the powers and functions of the National Treasury. Recently Mr Momoniat led the process for the adoption of the Carbon Tax Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to counter climate change. I as the Minister, the National Treasury team, and the broader financial family, welcome Mr Momoniat in this new acting role and assure him of our support and cooperation.

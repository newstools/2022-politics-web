Update on the wage talks 28 June 2022 Following a productive meeting earlier today between Eskom and union leadership, Eskom can confirm that it has agreed in-principle with the recognised labour unions on the way forward in the wage talks on Friday at the Central Bargaining Forum. Following this agreement, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) have urged their members to return to work immediately. Eskom also wishes to urge all employees to return to their workstations immediately to relieve the pressure on the system and to deliver the service the people of South Africa expect from Eskom, and to assist in restoring generation performance impacted by the strike. Eskom would also like to pay tribute and thank those many employees who keep going beyond the call of duty and continue to help the keep the lights on during this very challenging time. We also wish to thank the members of the South African Police Services who played a key role in ensuring that disruptions of law and order were minimised at power stations during the strike. It is important to note that while the workforce might have returned to work by tomorrow, the system will still take some time to recover. As a result of the strike, maintenance work has had to be postponed, and this backlog will take time to clear. Issued by Media Desk, 29 June 2022

KZN Flood Aid: ANC’s gross incompetence is compounding peoples’ misery 9 June 2022 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) has called for a National Treasury task team to be urgently deployed to the province to assist with the completion of documents needed to access R1 billion in flood aid which remains outstanding. It is almost two months since the first floods hit our province, yet not a cent in relief funding has arrived in KZN. This while National and Provincial Treasury squabble about supposedly inaccurate paperwork. The DA regards it as unacceptable that neither national or provincial government is recognizing the urgency of the situation and acknowledging the misery of so many. That it cannot even get the required documents in order is a sign of gross incompetence and further evidence of a failed state. The plight of KZN’s people is worsening by the day. Yesterday, flood victims from various areas gathered at the City Hall in Durban to air their grievances. They were chased away and were allegedly pepper-sprayed and had rubber bullets fired at them. The question is – what kind of government does this to its own people? If the ANC is in fact sincere about helping our people, then it needs to take action and send a task team to KZN to make it happen. This must be urgently motivated by KZN Finance MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube. KZN’s people have already suffered enough. The last thing they need, is a government that does not care about them.

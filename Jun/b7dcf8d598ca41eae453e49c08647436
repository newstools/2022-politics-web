City of Cape Town rescues residents from stage 6 loadshedding 28 June 2022 What a mark of good governance, that while Stage 6 loadshedding hits South Africa, the thriving City of Cape Town can protect its residents against two stages of loadshedding. Eskom is failing South Africans. Loadshedding does not only affect our daily lives at home, but it affects the economy and job creation in our country. We wish to thank the City of Cape Town for showing that they care about the people and for working hard and finding solutions to make life in the Western Cape better.

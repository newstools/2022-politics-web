Guptas: Arrests could pave the way for further action 7 June 2022 The FF Plus welcomes the arrest of Atul and Rajesh Gupta. The extradition process may, however, take some time and the Gupta brothers will no doubt strongly oppose it. The process can only be considered successful once they arrive in South Africa to stand trial on the charges against them. If they are extradited and successfully prosecuted, it will significantly improve South Africa's image in the eyes of the international community. It would create the impression that the government is indeed serious about bringing state capturers to book. These events could also pave the way for further legal action to be taken against those individuals who were implicated in state capture before the Zondo Commission. The FF Plus will monitor the process closely. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 7 June 2022

Crime statistics: South Africa is a dangerous country, especially for women and children 3 June 2022 It is not only the increase in ordinary crimes that is alarming, but also the sharp rise in kidnappings, which points to a new and upsetting crime trend in South Africa. The latest police statistics paint a sombre picture of crime, which is clearly getting out of hand. The most notable is kidnappings, which have increased with an alarming 109,2% in comparison to the corresponding quarter last year. Urgent attention must be paid to this so that South Africa is not mentioned in the same breath as countries like Columbia, Venezuela and Syria. Compared to the same period last year, all forms of violent crime have increased. Murder increased with 22,2%, (from 12 133 to 13 799), attempted murder with 24,8% (from 4 582 to 5 717), and assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm with 18,1% (from 36 417 to 42 992). Robbery rose with 13% (from 9 549 to 10 787), and robbery with aggravating circumstances with 6,5% (from 30 768 to 32 783). Another upsetting phenomenon is the sharp rise in the murder of children between 0 and 17 years, which has increased with 37,2% from 223 to 306. The murder of women also increased sharply with 17,5% (from 764 to 898). The police must stop making empty promises about combating crime and protecting women and children, and come up with a clear strategy. A growing trend like kidnapping must also be nipped in the bud. With regard to farm murders, the statistics indicate that there were 12 murders in the first quarter of this year in comparison to 11 in the same period last year. These figures, which reflect only the number of murders, do not paint a complete picture of the situation surrounding rural safety, and I asked that the number of attacks must also be included in the statistics. The rise in crime is upsetting. It can to a large extent be attributed to the infighting and feud between the former Police Commissioner, Gen. Kehla Sitole, and the Minister, Bheki Cele. In the process, combating crime was neglected. Against this backdrop, it is no wonder that the public is increasingly losing faith in the police. Research indicates that only 27% of the public still trusts the police. South Africa is becoming a dangerous country in which to live, and the government is failing to fulfil its duty to fight crime. South Africa and its people deserve better than the ANC. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 3 June 2022

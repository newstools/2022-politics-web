EFF WELCOMES THE DISMISSAL OF THE FRIVOLOUS CASE AGAINST EFF DEPUTY PRESIDENT, COMMISSAR FLOYD SHIVAMBU Wednesday, 01 June 2022 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) welcomes the sound, rational, and logical decision, to dismiss the politically motivated and right-wing inspired case, against the Deputy President of the EFF, Commissar Floyd Nyiko Shivambu. After more than three-years of a tedious and frivolous back and forth, over a matter involving an invasive and arrogant white-male journalist, sense prevailed over a witch-hunt, in which the state was exposed for having no basis for a case against the Deputy President. The conclusion of this case is a blatant rejection of an agenda by the liberal media, and vindicates the EFF in our long-held position that cases against the EFF and its leaders, are nothing but factional pursuits to taint the character of the leaders in the war for Economic Freedom. The EFF Deputy President will continue to focus on the work of quantitatively and qualitatively building the organisation, towards the immediate goal of 1 Million EFF Members before the end of 2022. All the charlatans, chance-takers, and agents of white-monopoly capital will continue to be exposed on the picket lines, on the benches of our judiciary, and across all spheres of society, as opportunists who can never defeat an idea whose time has come. Let us rally behind our collective leadership towards total victory in 2024! Hasta la victoria siempre! Statement issued by the EFF, 1 June 2022

EFF condemns the murder of Kwazulu-Natal fightersMxolisi Buthelezi 3 June 2022 The EFF is deeply saddened by the passing of Umkhanyakude District Chairperson, Fighter Mxolisi Buthelezi who was shot dead while on his way to attend organizational duties on Thursday morning. Buthelezi, who had just left his home in Ogengele area, was attacked by an unknown vehicle with suspects who fired gunshots at him in a drive- by shooting. He was killed on the spot while another Fighter who was with him at the time sustained injuries and was quickly rushed to a local clinic for medical attention. Buthelezi was a dedicated solider of the movement, who joined the EFF while it was not fashionable to do so. He was a committed activist of his community who served his people with pride. Not only was Buthelezi the Regional Chairperson of the EFF in Umkhanyakude but he was also a councillor and an Executive Member under the uMkhanyakude District Municipality . KwaZulu-Natal has always been known for political intolerance and it is shameful to note that since the establishment of the Moerane Commission of Inquiry in 2016, there has been no major breakthrough into these political killings. KZN continues to be a bloodbath for political killings and no meaningful intervention has been made by the ruling Government. We call on SAPS to move in quickly and investigate this matter with urgency and leave no stone unturned in trying to find those who were involved in the brutal murder of Fighter Buthelezi. We strongly condemn the ongoing political killings in the Province of Kwa-Zulu Natal and call for political stability and maturity particularly during this time. We further send our heartfelt condolences to the family, fighters, friends and colleagues of Buthelezi. We pray that they find solace in the Lord during this difficult time of grieving. May his soul Rest In Revolutionary Peace. Issued by Sinawo Thambo, National Spokesperson, EFF, 3 June 2022

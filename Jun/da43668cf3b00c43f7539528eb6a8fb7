EFF OPENS CASE OF ASSAULT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST THE SPEAKER OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY NOSIVIWE MAPISA-NQAKULA Friday, 10 June 2022 The Economic Freedom Fighters has opened a criminal case against the tyrannical, bloodthirsty and factional Speaker of the National Assembly, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, after she resolved to instruct thugs to barge into the National Assembly and assault Members of Parliament, In an overzealous attempt to sing for her supper, Mapisa-Nqakula relived the worst days of Former Speaker Baleka Mbethe, and defended Cyril Ramaphosa from scrutiny and accountability, through the use of brute force and the suppression of democratic engagement in Parliament, Under Mapisa-Nqakula's instruction, a woman was assaulted physically and sexually on Thursday, 09 June 2022, for daring to refuse that a money laundering, kidnapping and torture accused President, address the nation and Parliament, The compromised and violence-prone Speaker continued her desperate defence of Ramaphosa, and proceeded to preside over the silencing of Members of Parliament on the virtual platform, effectively excluding over 290-membes who are democratically elected from exercising their duties, What followed was the premeditated assault of Members of Parliament for three-hours, for demanding accountability, as the nation, the continent and the world watched, We want to warn Mapisa-Nqakula that her audition for the favour of Ramaphosa and the ruling party, at the expense of accountability and combatting corruption even by a Head of State, is nothing new and will end in shame, Her predecessor followed the exact same path, and her and the principal she abused Parliamentarians for, are now nowhere and the EFF was vindicated on both of their misconduct on numerous occasions, The Members of Parliament who were subjected to Mapisa-Nqakula's tyranny in service of Ramaphosa, have opened a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and sexual assault against Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, and the so-called Parliament Protection Services. The case has been opened at the Cape Town Central Police Station and the case number is as follows; CAS 458/6/2022 We call on the police to speedily act on the cases we have opened because they have always acted when cases are opened against EFF members whilst they did nothing when we opened the cases of abuse and assault against the parliamentary protection services during president Jacob Zuma's time, The EFF will pursue private prosecutions against speaker and the parliament protection services is there is nothing dune about the cases we have opened. The battle against Ramaphosa and his cronies is far from over, wherever he speaks and the EFF has an opportunity, we will ensure he answers to the grave accusations of money laundering against him, a crime which erodes our fiscus and is defined by criminality, tax evasion and illicit financial flow of funds, All brave battalions of the EFF, inside and outside of Parliament are willing to bleed in defence of South Africa from an international criminal, The War has been declared! Must Watch 🎥The violence lashed out on women MPs on the orders of the Speaker Mapisa-Nqakula All this to protect a criminal! #EFFInParliament pic.twitter.com/t4XAcmmgzc Issued by the EFF, 10 June 2022

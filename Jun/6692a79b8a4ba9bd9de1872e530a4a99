PIC statement on suspension of COO and resignation of senior officials 2 June 2022 Public Investment Corporation (PIC) has informed its clients that its Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Vuyani Hako, has been placed on precautionary suspension. Allegations of alleged misconduct were made against Mr. Hako. The PIC believes that the suspension is in the best interest of both the employee and the employer to ensure that an independent inquiry can proceed unencumbered. The PIC further states that its Executive Head: Research and Projects Development, Mr Sholto Dolamo, has tendered his resignation from the PIC, with effect from 30 June 2022. Mr Dolamo joined the PIC over 10 years ago, served in several capacities and was, until recently, the acting Chief Investment Officer (CIO). Another resignation is that of Ms Lusanda Kali, the acting Executive Head for Developmental Investments and Private Equity, which is effective as of 30 June 2022. The PIC would like to express its gratitude to both Mr Dolamo and Ms Kali for their service and wish them all the best as they pursue new opportunities and challenges. The PIC would like to assure all its stakeholders that these resignations and the suspension of its COO will not destablise the PIC’s ability to deliver on its investment mandate. The recent appointment of Mr Kabelo Rikhotso as CIO, combined with an established skills pool, will ensure that the PIC continues to deliver on its investment objectives.

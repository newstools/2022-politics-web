AfriForum welcomes decision to extend deadline for comments on BELA Bill 29 June 2022 The civil rights organisation AfriForum welcomed the decision of the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education to extend the period for written comments on the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill (better known as the BELA Bill) to 15 August 2022. According to the committee, numerous requests were received for an extension of the deadline, which was 15 June 2022. According to Alana Bailey, AfriForum’s Head of Cultural Affairs, AfriForum already submitted its comments on 14 June 2022. “However, the amendments proposed by this bill are so far-reaching that more time for stakeholders to respond is appropriate,” she said. On 22 June 2022, AfriForum asked the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, to withdraw the bill in light of remarks made by the Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi. He made it clear that he supports the bill because it can be used to destroy schools that offer Afrikaans-medium education once and for all. “Especially the BELA Bill’s proposals that deal with the decision-making powers regarding schools’ admissions and language policies would indeed make it possible and therefore we encourage all members of the public who have not taken a stand against the bill yet, to do so now,” Bailey added. The online petition launched by AfriForum to obtain support against the bill has now also been reactivated, in order that people can also make their voices heard against the bill via this channel.

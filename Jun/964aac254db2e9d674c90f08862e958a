EFF statement on letters to the South African Reserve Bank regarding the Phala-Phala farm burglary 30 June 2022 The EFF is concerned by the South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) failure to respond to a letter sent to the Governor with regards to the prima facia evidence of crime proceeds and money laundering at Cyril Ramaphosa's Phala Phala Wildlife Farm. We reasonably suspect that the SARB and the Governor are involved in covering up the crimes. The former Director-General of State Security and National Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services, Mr. Arthur Fraser, opened a criminal case against the President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa. In his witness statement, Mr. Fraser alluded to trespassing and housebreaking that occurred at the Phala Phala Wildlife Farm, where an undisclosed number of US dollars was stolen. According to the witness statement, Mr. Ramaphosa had kept cash in the region of USS4 million to US$8 million. The EFF wrote to the SARB and the Governor to ask them if: 1. South African Reserve Bank (SARB) aware of the money stored in Mr. Ramaphosa Wildlife Farm?2. If not, now that the SARB is aware, what has been the SARB's actions in relation to the money stored in Mr. Ramaphosa Wildlife Farm?3. If there was declaration of foreign currency brought into the country that ended up in Mr. Ramaphosa wildlife farm as required by law? The SARB has a mandate to regulate cross border transactions, preventing the abuse of the financial systems independently and without fear, favor or prejudice. We demand the SARB and the Governor respond to our correspondence before the end of this week or we will be left with no choice but to approach the court.

Weaponisation of allegations to settle political scores is throttling justice 7 June 2022 Serious allegations of impropriety and criminality by the President have been publicly aired and should be swiftly investigated to clear the air one way or another. But, as has become customary in South Africa, whether the allegations are proven true or not appears to matter less than the fact that the allegations have been made. The NPA and the Hawks must wrest back citizens' trust in the country's system of justice by being seen to be doing their work, expeditiously, professionally and without favour. Particularly when allegations have been publicly leveled against people occupying powerful public positions. With respect to the alleged theft of millions of dollars from his farmhouse – and the evidently questionable return of some of the money – President Ramaphosa must urgently take the nation into his confidence to prevent the matter spiraling into another interminable round of factional point scoring that the country can ill-afford. Law enforcement agencies must similarly conduct their investigations urgently and independently of considerations of the impact of their work on political party leadership contestation. If laws have been broken there must be consequences for the law breakers. If laws haven't been broken the allegations must be dismissed.

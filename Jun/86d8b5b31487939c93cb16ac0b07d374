South Africa has the right to know why Zondo is dragging feet with submitting final report 21 June 2022 Numerous questions are raised by the fact that the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture failed to submit its final report for disclosure to President Cyril Ramaphosa by the deadline. The only reason provided was that certain "circumstances" lead to the delay. The people of South Africa have the right to know what these so-called circumstances are so that they can judge for themselves whether they are justified or not. There are also reports of a meeting that had supposedly taken place between the President and Judge Raymond Zondo. The public have the right to know what was discussed during this meeting and why it was held. Such things inevitably create suspicion. It must be kept in mind that more than a billion rand of taxpayers' money was used for the inquiry into allegations of state capture and corruption. The people want the assurance that their money is used sensibly, and that corruption will be eradicated In a situation like this, the public are justified when they start voicing their concerns about whether justice will ultimately be served. The fact that the report will apparently be released tomorrow (Wednesday) is not enough. Answers must be provided to the many questions, particularly why it was not submitted by the specified time.

Ramaphosa must be charged and removed as president 14 June 2022 Yesterday, 13 June 2022, Comrades Carl Niehaus and Sibusiso Hadebe, as ANC members, filed sworn affidavits at the Rosebank Police Station, in support of the charges of money laundering and corruption that Arthur Fraser laid against Cyril Ramaphosa on the 1st of June 2022. They did so specifically as ANC members insisting that Ramaphosa must – like every other citizen - be treated as equal before the law, and that the SAPS must carry out their duties without fear or favour and charge him. This is part of a nationwide campaign of ANC members and South African citizens,  throughout the country, mobilising and going to police stations to file supporting affidavits/charges insisting that Ramaphosa must be criminally charged, and that the ANC NEC must remove him as President of the ANC and the country.

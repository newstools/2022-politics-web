Mayor reiterates call to President for full capacity events 14 June 2022 I reiterate my call to President Cyril Ramaphosa to lift all remaining event capacity restrictions, so that we can have a bumper sell-out crowd for the URC Finals at DHL Cape Town Stadium this Saturday. I have previously written to President Ramaphosa without success, and I’ve written to him again asking for these limits to be lifted urgently this week. I invite the President to attend the game between the Stormers and Bulls himself, with a 55 000 capacity crowd. Cape Town has proven in a number of major events that we can handle large crowds safely and without any Covid-19 spike, and all of the science and hospitalisation numbers now show that any continuation of these restrictions is unnecessary. Secondly, we are preparing for bigger crowds on Saturday by arranging additional MyCiti bus routes from Cape Town Civic Centre to the Stadium, and by opening the Fan Walk to allow fans to walk to the stadium from the CBD. Fans should please refer to the City’s website for details on extra bus routes. These measures will help alleviate traffic in and around the stadium, but we still encourage fans to leave early. We are making provision for bigger crowds. We are ready for bigger crowds. Let’s open up, let’s get the crowds back into our stadiums. Issued by City of Cape Town, 14 June 2022

DA-run uMngeni passes R537 million 2022/23 budget 01 June 2022 The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal is pleased to announce that the uMngeni 2022/23 budget tabled by Mayor Christopher Pappas was passed yesterday. This budget prioritizes service delivery and inequalities that have been created by years of failed ANC governance in the municipality. The Mayor has been able to balance the budget to ensure that infrastructure that’s been previously neglected is fixed. The budget was allocated in a way that ensures residents of uMngeni get the services that they pay for. It is no surprise that the ANC in uMngeni opposed the budget, they are clearly not used to a budget that focuses on getting things done for residents. We were not just campaigning in 2021, when we said we would focus on 5 key basics. To keep our promise to the residents of uMngeni, the budget includes: - R23.3 million for roads (up by R11 million) - R1.45 million for youth (up by R450 000) - R250 000 inserv training (new) - R31 million electricity maintenance - R700 000 disaster management (up by R400 000) - R600 000 Agriculture (up R300 000) - R300k SMMEs (up by R130 000) - R160 million for Eskom (up by R8 million) - R2.5 million for street light repairs (up R1 million) - R10 million landfill rehabilitation (up by R5 million) - R3 million for ICT infrastructure (up by R2 million) - R5 million for indigent support (new) - R150 000 Hilton electricity legal (new) - R3 million on land reform, surveys, planning (up R2 million) This budget indicates that we are no longer in a crisis mode and that the financial situation has improved significantly. It is now the task of the Mayor and his council to ensure the implementation of the budget so that we can be able to improve the lives of residents of uMngeni.

EFF condemns homophobic stigma regarding the spread of monkeypox 24 June 2022 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) condemns in the strongest terms the homophobic and dangerous rhetoric which is being spread around the most recent Monkeypox outbreak. South Africa has officially identified its first case of the disease, which has historically been contracted through animals and is spread through close bodily contact, exchange of fluids or contact with any items which come into contact with an infected person. This important discovery, has now been clouded by dangerous, hurtful and discriminatory commentary attributing the spread of the disease to the sexual relations between men. This harmful and baseless messaging, is reminiscent of the early stages of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and is not based on any scientific or logical argument. The Monkeypox disease can be contracted by anyone and any attempt to blame homosexual men for the spread of Monkeypox is pseudo-science which is rooted in hate. We must all desist from targeting vulnerable communities and creating stigma. We must desist from returning to the dark periods where diseases are attributed to the LGBTQl-community, as a means of reinforcing bigotry, hatred and discrimination. The EFF reaffirms the stance of the National Institute For Communicable Diseases (NICO) which calls for calm and responsible messaging around the disease. We call on the government to manage the spread of this disease responsibly. strategically and swiftly, and learn from the clumsiness and corruption they displayed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

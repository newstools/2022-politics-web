DA welcomes the disconnection of 800 illegal electricity connections at the Brazzaville informal settlement last week 25 July 2022 Illegal connections cannot be tolerated as it does harm to local businesses in the area, causing a negative impact on the economy.  It is also not fair towards paying residents and business owners who to have to suffer due to an unstable network as a result of illegal connections. The City of Tshwane Energy and Electricity Department, working in collaboration with the Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) and the South Africa Police Service (Danville Station), successfully executed an operation to disconnect 800 illegal electricity connections at Brazzaville informal settlement last week. We further welcome the confiscation of electrical material to the value of R400 000.  Some of the material included 11kV overhead lines and medium voltage transformers.  Theft of municipal or state property is not only a crime against the municipality but a crime against the residents.  Theft of power and electrical material increase the trips and damage to appliances after loadshedding. Furthermore, illegal connections contribute to the non-revenue losses of the City which has a negative impact on financial sustainability.  This in turn impacts the availability to improve services to the communities. We urge residents to be alert and assist in reporting suspicious illegal connections immediately to the City. Together we can fight the crime of illegal connections and theft of infrastructure to ensure a more stable network that creates opportunity for businesses to flourish.

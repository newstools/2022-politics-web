ANC reaffirms call for investment in renewal energies – rejects attempts to distort clear and progressive proposals 8 July 2022 The African National Congress notes with dismay that some have chosen to distort the call made by the National Executive Committee for businesses and households to invest in renewable energies as an attempt to shift the responsibility and burden of dealing with the electricity crisis away from government onto citizens. This is false, irresponsible and counter-productive. The call for investment in renewable energies was but one element in a comprehensive range of measures that the NEC urged government and Eskom to consider, including: (a) increasing maintenance and improving the availability of existing supply, (b) that Eskom should acquire appropriate skills and experienced mentors, (c) facilitate private investment in new generation capacity, (d) speed up the repurposing of power stations with alternate energy sources, (e) accelerate the procurement of battery storage, (f) empower municipalities to procure additional electricity and that Government must speed up reforms in the energy sector. Responsibility to the bulk of these measures lies with Government and Eskom, not with citizens. The call for investment in renewable energy is not new. It forms part of our overall national effort to manage demand and promote greater reliance on renewable energy as part of a just energy transition. As far back as 2009 Government embarked on a solar water heating (SWH) programme that was managed by Eskom in the form of the "SWH Rebate Programme". The programme was rolled out in various municipalities and sought to involve the private sector. Investment in renewable energies by all sectors of society, including businesses and households, working together with government, can make contribution to the just energy transition, and promote local industries and job creation.

Malema and Ndlozi show no remorse in court over alleged assault 1 July 2022 The trial of EFF leader Julius Malema and EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi on charges of assault on SAPS Colonel Johannes Venter resumed in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court today. The civil rights organisation AfriForum is acting in terms of a watching brief in this matter. AfriForum became involved in the case after the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) initially did not want to prosecute the accused. After AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit wrote a letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), the NPA decided to prosecute. The alleged incident took place at Winnie Mandela's funeral in 2018, after the accused's vehicle was stopped by Venter. The accused then left the vehicle and allegedly assaulted Venter. CCTV footage of the incident was widely circulated in the media. Mbuyiseni Ndlozi testified in the case today. The defense had earlier brought a Section 174 application after closing the state’s case to acquit the accused based on insufficient evidence. However, this application was rejected by the court because the court found that there was prima facie evidence of assault which had to be answered to. “Malema and Ndlozi’s testimony prove that they have no remorse for their actions to allegedly assault a SAPS Colonel in full uniform at Winnie Mandela’s funeral in 2018. The SAPS’s only role is to protect the community and prominent politicians must be held accountable if they do not respect this role. AfriForum will continue to stand for justice in this matter,” says Reiner Duvenage Campaign Officer for Strategy and Content at AfriForum The trial has been postponed until 29 September 2022, for the preparation of final arguments, after which the court will also deliver a ruling.

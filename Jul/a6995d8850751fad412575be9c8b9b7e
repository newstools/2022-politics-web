NPA’s Investigating Directorate (ID) uncovers further millions in SAPS PPE contract 20 July 2022 The Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court deferred the SAPS R8.5m PPE contract and the procurement of plumbing material to 13 October 2022, for defence consultation and further instructions. The matter was initially enrolled as a R1.9m corruption case but has now escalated to R8.5 m with two further contracts amounting to R4,1m and R2m, respectively and a plumbing material contract for R120 000. The total tally of accused now stands at 26, with five new accused, Abigayke Essau, Prinesh Naidoo, Jane Mthembu and two companies Impokane General Trade and Distribution PTY LTD and Imbobezi Enterprises Pty Ltd added to the matter. The group faces charges of corruption, theft, fraud and forgery. The accused were arrested for allegations of having caused a supplier to unduly benefit from the procurement of latex gloves in April 2020 for the SAPS nationally. The arrests follow an investigation into the capture of the SAPS procurement and supply chain to aid front companies to score lucrative contracts and facilitate kickbacks to SAPS senior officials. One of the accused, a former Brigadier James Ramanjalum has failed to get bail twice after having lost his latest high court bail application. He has notified court that he plans to apply for bail for the third time in the Palm Ridge Specialised Crimes Court, based on new facts on 26 July 2022.

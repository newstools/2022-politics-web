Health announces disciplinary hearing outcomes 21 July 2022 The Department of Health would like to announce the outcomes of the Disciplinary Hearing process involving officials suspended last year following the investigations by an independent forensic audit firm and the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) into the awarding of communications contract to Digital Vibes. The Department of Health through the Office of the State Attorney in the Department of Justice appointed an Independent Senior Counsel to preside over the Disciplinary Hearing following the findings in the report by the SIU into the Digital Vibes contract in which three senior departmental officials (namely; Dr Anban Pillay, Mr Popo Maja and Mrs Shireen Pardesi) were implicated. The department received the disciplinary hearing report from the Presiding Officer/Chairperson on 6 June 2022 where the following findings were communicated to the Department: Dr Anban Pillay faced 4 charges and was found guilty on one charge Mr Popo Maja was facing 4 charges and was found guilty on two charges Mrs Shireen Pardesi was facing two charges and was found guilty on one charge As part of consultation, the Presiding Officer requested the Department of Health (through the Office of the State Attorney) to make submissions into possible sanctions and allowed the legal representatives of the employees to make representations on mitigating factors, and also allowed the parties to share notes where possible. The Chairperson considered the evidence obtained, his findings and the representations by the parties. He also considered the fact that all those charged were first time offenders, and there was no evidence led that suggest that they benefitted from the transactions. Thus, based on all the afore-mentioned facts, the Presiding Officer confirmed the following sanctions: Dr Anban Pillay shall receive a final written warning valid for 15 months and suspension without pay for three months, which will be followed by salary level demotion for a period of 12 months. Mr Popo Maja shall receive a final written warning valid for 12 months and salary level demotion for a period of 12 months. Mrs Shireen Pardesi proposed that she be allowed to resign from the Department with immediate effect, and that was agreed by all parties and confirmed by the Presiding Officer.

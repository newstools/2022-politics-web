DA notes ActionSA’s media briefing that confirms their support for the EFF and cadre deployment 26 July 2022 The DA in KwaZulu-Natal has noted today's press conference held by ActionSA, the Independent Alliance and the African Independent Congress. Three other parties in addition to the DA, who have been involved in the coalition talks, chose not to attend the press conference and support ActionSA’s public statements. ActionSA continues to support an influential role for the EFF. Even more disturbing was ActionSA’s support for cadre deployment. They described the appointment of senior managers as a “political process”. This is exactly how cadre deployment has been used by the ANC to capture the state. Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has described it as unconstitutional. The DA abides by due process of law in formulating budget. Anything else would be illegal. Should ActionSA be prepared to move away from these issues, the DA is more than happy to resume talks. The ball is in ActionSA’s court. Issued by Dean Macpherson, DA KZN Chairperson, 26 July 2022

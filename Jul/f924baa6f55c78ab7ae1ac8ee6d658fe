EFF condemns the hijacking of EFF Head of Presidency, Commissar Viyani Pambo 28 June 2022 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) condemns the hijacking of the EFF Head of Presidency, Commissar Vuyani Pambo on the evening of the 27th of June 2022. In a trend of violent crime which characterises South African society, three-armed men approached the car of Commissar Pambo, taking his vehicle and demanding money. The individuals, who were three well-built, masked men operated with precision, and took the vehicle of Commissar Pambo outside the household of his mother, which is in a quiet and unassuming neighbourhood. The armed men drove around with the vehicle, and fled with his personal belongings which include his passport, identity document, organisational material and other valuables. After completing their heist, they left the car behind. It is clear through the manner in which the operation was conducted, that it was premeditated, with the intention of intimidation and securing of certain valuable documents and information. The EFF is thankful that Commissar Pambo was not hurt during this incident, especially that his child, his mother and himself, were left unharmed This incident reveals yet again that no one is immune to criminal activity in South Africa, and that the continued incompetence of this government has given criminals boldness to strike with full knowledge that there will be no consequence. The levels of criminality, especially of organised crime have reached intolerable levels, particularly abductions, hijackings and assassinations. The EFF calls on law enforcement agencies to increase their efforts of fighting crime and practice increased visibility. The only deterrent to violent crime is increased visibility and arrests of culprits in a swift manner. Issued by Sinawo Thambo, National Spokesperson, EFF, 28 June 2022

Directives for renewal of firearm licenses issued – AfriForum welcomes clarity 6 July 2022 AfriForum welcomes the clarity that the SAPS has achieved regarding the renewal of expired firearm licenses, by issuing directives that have apparently been circulating at police stations across the country since 1 July 2022. Earlier this year, the Constitutional Court ruled in favor of Fidelity Security Services (Pty) Ltd. in that firearm owners whose licenses have already expired may not be prohibited from renewing their licenses to be in lawful possession of such firearms again. According to this decision, AfriForum has indicated that Bheki Cele, the Minister of Police, must provide clarity as soon as possible on the process that firearm owners must follow to give expression to the court's decision. The required directives were issued by Lt.Gen. Michael Motlhala and outlines the processes to be followed by the public, as well as SAPS members involved in license renewals. In short, any licensee whose firearm license has expired is entitled to apply for renewal without any fear of prosecution or expropriation of their firearm. “We are delighted that the necessary clarity was given to the court order as soon as possible after the court order and trust that members of the SAPS will handle any renewal applications in accordance with the court order and directives. We believe that many firearm owners who were left in the dark due to the uncertainty that prevailed regarding renewal applications submitted to the SAPS after the expiry date, are now a thing of the past,” says Armand Greyling, Legal and Risk Officer at AfriForum.

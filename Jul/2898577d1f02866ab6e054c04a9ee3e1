DA urges parents to apply for the 2023 online admission to secure their children’s school placement 20 July 2022 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng urges parents and guardians to apply for their children’s school placement on time to avoid the last-minute and late application process. The 2023 online admission process for the Grades 1 and 8 will open on Friday, 22 July and closes on 19 August 2022. Since the inception of this online system in 2016, parents experienced numerous problems like glitches in the system and officials manipulating gaps in the system to place their children. This frustrated many parents who applied on time because their children were not appearing on the system. Furthermore, the delays by parents in submitting their applications have resulted in many learners across the province missing months of schooling. In most cases, learners were placed in schools that have not been chosen by their parents. The DA believes that if parents apply early, all the challenges which they confront during the process can be resolved before the closing date of the online admission process. We also urge parents who do not have access to the internet to visit the nearest department regional office to be assisted with their online application. The DA will monitor the opening of the online admission process to ensure that the process runs smoothly and will liaise with the department should parents continue to face any difficulties with the online system. We will also continue to hold the department to account to ensure that parents who have followed all processes and applied on time get placement for their children in their preferred schools. It is the department's responsibility to ensure that all applications received before the closing date are processed within the stipulated timeframe.

DA calls on the SIU to obtain a preservation order against NLC commissioner 29 July 2022 Note to Editors: Please find attached soundbite by Mat Cuthbert MP. The DA calls on the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to obtain a preservation order against the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) Commissioner, Thabang Mampane, from the Special Tribunal (ST). This comes after revelations by publication GroundUp that she used money meant for the rebuilding of a school, gutted by fire, to purchase a luxury home worth R3.6 million in a golf estate near Hartebeespoort Dam. It is alleged that the house was registered in a trust of which Mampane and her family were beneficiaries. Moreover, GroundUp alleges that the money was channelled through a company linked to notorious NLC COO, Philemon Letwaba, which has been cited in several other cases of corruption involving the NLC. This is the second public revelation in just over a month, which fingers a senior member of the NLC’s leadership having purchased a home with money meant for grannies, the sick and marginalised communities. Furthermore, we call on the NLC’s new board to swiftly conclude disciplinary action against her and in the interim place her on suspension.

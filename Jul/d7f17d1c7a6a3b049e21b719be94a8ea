Unfunded municipal budgets adopted in the North West due to collaboration between EFF and ANC 1 July 2022 In an alarming turn of events, the ANC succeeded in adopting three unfunded municipal budgets in the North West with the support of the EFF. The ANC was able to approve these budgets, with the support of the EFF, in the JB Marks (Potchefstroom and Ventersdorp), Mamusa (Schweizer-Reneke and Amalia) and Lekwa Taemane (Bloemhof and Christiana) Local Municipalities, despite obvious irregularities in the budgetary processes. This collaboration is either driven by political opportunism and the need to protect shared interests that voters are unaware of, or it is a new trend with potentially catastrophic consequences for the North West, and the entire country, after the upcoming 2024 elections. These new annual budgets seemed to be aimed at protecting vested interests, while burning issues relating to service delivery and the maintenance of critical infrastructure are once again neglected. The communities in these municipalities have been severely affected by corruption, mismanagement and cadre deployment. Voters must take note of the collaboration between the ANC and its new-found EFF ally. The people of the North West deserve better than the ANC.

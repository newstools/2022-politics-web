Cele’s Khayelitsha performance did not impress anyone: DA will continue to call for SAPS devolution 19 July 2022 The DA is appalled by Minister Bheki Cele’s dismissal of the Western Cape government's efforts to devolve policing to a provincial level. He dismissed it as a waste of "time and energy” because he desperately wants to cling to absolute power - even at the expense of South Africans' security. His visit to Khayelitsha yesterday was little more than shameful political grandstanding. Arriving at the venue to the strains of the song “I will survive” was not only callous, but also showed how little he cares for the safety of our people and is testament to his disrespect for South Africans who live in fear every day. Minister Cele cannot continue to deny that SAPS in the Western Cape is under-resourced. At several oversight inspections in the Western Cape, the DA found that the challenges SAPS face is systemic. From staff shortages to dilapidated office infrastructure, policing in the Western Cape is critically under-resourced. Under Cele’s watch, SAPS has become totally deficient. Every day, in South Africa, 67 people are murdered, 153 people are raped and 364 violent robberies take place. We are losing the war on crime, and Minister Cele is not capable of turning things around. Bheki Cele cannot do his job. He must go. If South Africans agree that Cele must go, they can sign our petition demanding President Ramaphosa to fire Bheki Cele now.

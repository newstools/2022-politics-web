Special Investigating Unit welcomes high court decision to dismiss Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s appeal to reverse repayment order 19 July 2022 The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) welcomes the ruling of the high court to dismiss former SABC chief operating officer, Mr. Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s application for leave to appeal the court’s decision to pay back money that he gained unlawfully. The High Court of South Africa: Gauteng Local Division, Johannesburg on Friday, 15 July 2022, ruled that Motsoeneng’s leave to appeal is dismissed with costs and has ordered him to repay the SABC R11,508,549.12 paid to him as a success fee with interest, calculated from 13 September 2016 to date of payment. In December 2021, the court declared that the 19 August 2016 decision by the then SABC Board to pay Motsoeneng a success fee amounting to over R11,5 million for clinching a Multi Choice deal was unlawful and invalid.The Multi Choice deal gave the pay television service provider access to the SABC’s archives. The SIU together with the SABC approached the High Court to review and set aside a decision by the former SABC Board to pay Motsoeneng a success fee and recover financial losses suffered by the SABC.The Court action was informed by the SIU investigation in the affairs of the SABC, which revealed that the SABC irregularly paid monies to individuals and entered into contracts to the detriment of the public broadcaster. The SIU investigated the SABC in terms of Proclamation R29 of 2017, authorised by President Cyril Ramaphosa to investigate allegations of corruption, maladministration, malpractice and payments made by the SABC together with the conducts of its employees.Where required, the SIU was authorised to institute civil proceedings, refer evidence pointing to criminality to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for prosecution in line with the Special Investigating Units and Special Tribunals Act 74 of 1996.

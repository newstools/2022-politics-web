DA’s FLC recommends that WC Speaker be charged with misconduct 21 July 2022 The DA’s Federal Legal Commission (FLC) has, after due consideration, recommended that the Speaker of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament Masizole Mnqasela be charged with misconduct. This investigation stemmed from protected disclosures by whistle-blowers alleging fraud and/or corruption relating to subsistence, travel and entertainment allowance claims by Mr Mnqasela. The DA FEDEX (Federal Executive) has resolved to accept the FLC recommendation. As required by the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, the DA has also reported the matter to the Hawks for investigation, including the documentary evidence provided in the protected disclosures. The DA has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption, and when evidence-based allegations arise, we hold our office bearers to account, without fear or favour.

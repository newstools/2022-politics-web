IFP calls for urgent investigation into Sweetwaters attack 10 July 2022 The IFP calls for KwaZulu-Natal Police Commissioner, General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, to institute an urgent investigation following the killing of four people last night at Sweetwaters Tavern, outside Pietermaritzburg. This devastating news has left the IFP in a state of shock. We are concerned that similar incidents have occurred in Gauteng, leaving us concerned that liquor outlets are fast becoming hotspots for criminal activity. We urge the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (EDTEA) to investigate the legality of the mushrooming taverns, which have become targets of criminality. This province cannot afford more liquor outlets, as it already has over 6 000 legal outlets. This is a recipe for disaster, as police officers are far outnumbered. Further, the IFP calls for heightened compliance campaigns to ensure safety and compliance. Burdened with a tragic past, due in large, to political violence, this province cannot tolerate this kind of incident, where innocent people are attacked while at a social gathering. This will not only impact the already struggling hospitality industry, but it will leave a bitter taste for the province, which has suffered multiple murders in the recent past. We urge law enforcement to apply strict regulations to taverns and sheebens; particularly as regards the age of the patrons. We also call for owners to install surveillance cameras and provide maximum security for places of leisure.

THE EFF STATEMENT ON THE PASSING AWAY OF FORMER PRESIDENT OF ANGOLA CDE. JOSE EDUARDO dos SANTOS Saturday, 09th July 2022 The Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) sends its heart felt revolutionary condolences to the family, the government and people of the People's Republic of Angola on the death of second founding President of the independent sovereign state of Angola. Cde. President Eduardo joined The People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) as a 19-year old student to fight for the independence and freedom of the people of Angola from the yoke of imperial Portuguese colonial power. Following the death of founding President, Antonio Agostinho Neto in 1979, Cde. dos Santos was nominated by the MPLA to lead the country in the transition from a colonial enclave to the second biggest producer of oil in Africa. He shall be best remembered for his revolutionary stance against American Imperialism supporting apartheid South Africa and rebels of Jonas Savimbi, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). He led from the front in the trenches of Cuito Cuinavale defeating the white apartheid army, sending them with their tails in the legs out of Angola and Namibia in 1988. Together with the people of Namibia, we remain indebted to his leadership in the war for liberation of Namibia and South Africa during the border wars. He opened up his country to Cuba and then Soviet Union to train, arm and fight the Botha-Malan junta on two fronts of the border wars with UNITA and the apartheid South African Defence Force (SADF). Hated by apartheid whites and the West, loved by Africans of the South, he will forever be an indelible mark in the annals of Liberation struggle history. May His Soul find peace with our Creator. Hasta la victoria siempre ! Issued by the EFF, 9 July 2022

DA condemns murder and attack of prominent Ladysmith farmers 14 July 2022 The DA in Uthukela District condemns the murder of a commercial farmer and the attack on another. Both farmers were shot multiple times whilst at the Truck Stop outside Ladysmith last night. The victims of this shooting, Gerry Khumalo, who is injured and in hospital, and Sibusiso Gama, who was killed, are successful commercial farmers in the Ladysmith area. The DA extends our condolences to the Gama and Khumalo families at this time of tragedy and pray for strength for them to deal with these sad events. We call on the police to make every possible effort to identify the perpetrators of this gruesome crime as well as the motives for it. The perpetrators must face the harshest possible consequences for their actions. The DA has requested time and again that a special task team be established to deal with ongoing attacks on our rural communities. Regrettably, our calls keep falling on deaf ears. Farmers are critical to our survival in this country, and the attacks on them are being ignored. Issued by Alf Lees, DA uThukela District Constituency Head, 14 July 2022

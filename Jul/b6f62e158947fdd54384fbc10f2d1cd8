North West Provincial Government welcomes apology by City Press following a misleading article published by the newspaper 12 July 2022 Mahikeng – The North West Provicial Government acknowledges the apology by the Sunday Newspaper - City Press following a misleading article published by the newspaper in April earlier this year. The article indicates that the North West Provincial Government pays R17 Billion back to National Treasury because the provincial government departments have been unable to spend the money. North West Premier, Kaobitsa Bushy Maape said the apology by City Press, is restating our resolve from the beginning that the story and how it was reported was not only misleading but factually incorrect. “Whilst respecting the media and its critical role in society, as the provincial government we call for responsible journalism, fact checking and critical reporting that builds and not undermine the trust between government and the people. The provincial government is once more annoucing its open door policy to all media houses to avoid such unnecessary mistakes which undermine the right of our communities to have access to correct and factual stories published by the media” said Premier Maape.

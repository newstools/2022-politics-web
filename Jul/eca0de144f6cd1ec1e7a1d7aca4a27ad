DA welcomes appointment of Mandisa Maya as Deputy Chief Justice 25 July 2022 Note to Editors: Please find attached soundbite by Adv Glynnis Breytenbach MP. The DA welcomes the appointment of Mandisa Maya as the Deputy Chief Justice of South Africa. We wish her the best in this crucial role and trust that she will uphold judicial independence and the principle of Constitutionalism. The judiciary finds itself in a precarious situation. As more instances of ANC corruption and malfeasance came to light, the judiciary has been under constant attack so as to escape accountability. Justice Maya must use her position to push back against all attempts to discredit the judiciary. A strong, independent judiciary is the backbone of a free and fair society where all are equal under the law. Deputy Chief Justice Maya’s role to protect and build the judiciary is vital in keeping this ideal alive. Issued by Glynnis Breytenbach, DA Shadow Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, 25 July 2022

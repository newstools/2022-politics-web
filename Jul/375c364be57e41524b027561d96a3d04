SAPS oversight inspections kick off in the Western Cape 25 July 2022 In the wake of the horrifying crime statistics released in June this ye ar, the recent surge in gun violence in Khayelitsha, as well as the reported drastic decline in detectives at police stations, the DA in the Western Cape is embarking on a 100-day campaign in which the party will conduct oversight inspections at various police stations across the province. At these inspections, we will give attention to a variety of aspects, including the number of operational vehicles, the number of rape kits in stock, shortages of detectives, and the fixed establishment of personnel at each station. Statistics made it abundantly clear that the South African Police Service (SAPS) is losing the fight against crime, and the situation in the Western Cape is exacerbated by the fact that policing in the province is critically under-resourced – a fact that the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, continues to deny. Minister Cele is unfit to serve in his position and he is failing the residents of the Western Cape. People are living in constant fear for their lives and the Minister seems incapable of doing anything to make it safer for all. The DA cares about the safety of residents and will, therefore, embark on determining the shortcomings at our police stations, which will guide us in formulating feasible proposals to address these challenges in the Western Cape.

DA welcomes judgment that Brian Molefe must pay back R10 million 7 July 2022 Note to Editors: Please find attached soundbite by Ghaleb Cachalia MP. The DA welcomes the court’s decision to enforce the payment of R9 985 540 plus interest calculated from 31 October 2019 by former CEO of Eskom, Brian Molefe, to the power utility’s pension fund. This is an endorsement of a previous legal process dating back to 2018 when the same court set aside all Molefe’s pension payouts in a case brought to the North Gauteng High Court by the DA and the trade union, Solidarity. This represents a victory against rampant corruption in Eskom and other SOEs, which the DA has championed from the outset. The DA hopes that this heralds a continuation of processes that will bring the architects of State capture to book – an endeavour which the DA will continue to champion in the wake of the damning report by the Zondo commission. This represents the dogged oversight of a loyal opposition – loyal to our country and Constitution – which we will not let up. The consequences of actions by Molefe and others are plain for all South Africans to see – even under the dimming lights of Eskom. South Africa deserves better. Issued by Ghaleb Cachalia, DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, 7 July 2022

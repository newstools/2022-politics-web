ANC humbled by electoral inroads in by-elections 8 July 2022 The African National Congress is encouraged by the outcomes of the municipal by-elections held across the country on Wednesday the 6th of July 2022. We are humbled by the confidence our people continue to demonstrate in the ANC. In Matzikama ward 7, the ANC increased its support by 9% compared to the 2021 results. The ANC retained its wards in both Chief Albert Luthuli ward 3 in Mpumalanga, with a 70% victory and Nelson Mandela Bay ward 7 in the Eastern Cape, with a 69% victory. We are concerned about the low voter turnout and encourage citizens to exercise their democratic right to vote. In order to strengthen our democracy and build a society anchored on the will of the people, we must encourage active citizenry that plays an active role in the governance of the country and hold elected leaders accountable. Despite the challenges communities experience, their participation in local government can only ensure that councillors they elect are held accountable for improved service delivery. We salute the dedication and hard work our volunteers put in mobilizing voters to rally behind the ANC. All ANC councillors must continue to work hard to realise the aspirations of our people. The work of all ANC public representatives is to decisively push back the frontiers of poverty, and infuse accelerated service delivery as the guiding principle that underpins service delivery.

AfriForum neighbourhood watches hold national mass patrol 11 July 2022 The AfriForum neighbourhood watches across South Africa, in collaboration with the SAPS, the local CPF, community members, various security companies and security institutions, conducted a mass patrol on 8 June 2022 in their respective areas to create policing visibility. The patrol started around 18:00 and continued until 08:00 the next morning. A total of 2 090 patrollers took part in the national patrol and covered 72 176 km in 1 634 vehicles. During the patrol, the neighbourhood watches responded to 88 incidents across the country. “Apart from the high fuel prices, AfriForum members and the other organisations still drove more than 72 000 km to make a difference in their respective neighbourhoods and on farms. More than 155 AfriForum neighbourhood watches will continuously undertake projects and hold regular patrols to curb crime in collaboration with the SAPS and other security institutions and promote security,” says Raymond Hohls, AfriForum's Acting Head of Safety.

DA WC concerned over zero rate of taxi violence convictions 29 July 2022 After yet another Cape Town taxi associate was murdered, the Minister of Community Safety and Police Oversight, Reagen Allen, confirmed in a parliamentary reply that ZERO convictions have resulted from any of the 267 cases reported between May 2020 and March 2022. This is once again an example of the disturbing truth that the national government is not doing enough to address the safety concerns in the minibus taxi industry. In order to further engage the relevant stakeholders on matters like the ongoing taxi conflicts, I invited SAPS and SANTACO last month to appear before the Standing Committee. MPP Ricardo Mackenzie says: “A man was killed on Tuesday night leaving behind family, friends, and loved ones. He was a taxi owner who employed drivers which gave the younger generation employment opportunities. Because of the ongoing conflict in the taxi industry, his life was cut short when he was shot in his home in Lower Crossroads. As the DA in the Western Cape, we extend our most sincere condolences to those who are mourning his passing. If taxi violence-related cases are not prosecuted in due course, SAPS and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) must account and explain to the Standing Committee where these cases end up. In the past year, the Western Cape has seen a rapid increase in taxi violence incidents. When so many lives have been lost, it is incomprehensible that no one has been sent to prison.” Issued by Ricardo Mackenzie, DA Western Cape Spokesperson on Transport, 29 July 2022

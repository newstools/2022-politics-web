EFF welcomes the recent decision of the High Court on Ramaphosa’s involvement in the Marikana massacre 4 July 2022 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) welcomes the recent High Court ruling that Cyril Ramaphosa be held liable for the events that led to the Marikana Massacre. Ramaphosa has a case to answer as the alleged mastermind of the toxic collusion between the South African government and Sibanye-Stillwater (formerly Lonmin) which resulted in the massacre of workers in Marikana. With 10 years after the Marikana massacre, this is a small, but significant step in the right direction. The trial is long overdue for Ramaphosa to be exposed for his toxic role in the gunning down of mine workers, so that there is justice for the victims of the Massacre. It is also tragic that Ramaphosa refuses to apologize for his evil deeds, which he perpetrated purely for the love of money. The Marikana Massacre, BOSASA, and the recent Phala Phala Farm Gate scandals, all prove the fact that the love of money will be the downfall of the greedy Cyril Ramaphosa. In the immediate, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) must now charge Ramaphosa criminally for his role in the massacre of African mine workers whose only sin was asking for a living wage. The time has now come for Ramaphosa to step down immediately, so that he does not take the whole country down with him under the weight of his many scandals. Ramaphosa must go now!

SRWP Congratulates the newly elected NUMSA National Office Bearers 28 July 2022 The Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party (SRWP) congratulates NUMSA on the election and renewal of mandate for National Office Bearers, in its 11th National Congress. Democracy has prevailed in the workers parliament and militant metalworkers have expressed unquestionable confidence and trust in the newly elected leadership as they were nominated and duly elected unopposed by the NUMSA Regions. The leadership elected on 27 July 2022 is as follows: Andrew Chirwa has been elected as the President. Mac Chavalala has been elected as the 1st Deputy President. Puleng Phaka has been elected as the 2nd Deputy President. Mphumzi Maqungo has been elected as the National Treasurer. Irvin Jim has been elected as the General Secretary. Mbuso Ngubane has been elected as the Deputy General Secretary. We are inspired as the SRWP by the resilience, fortitude, and resolve displayed by NUMSA delegates to the Congress. NUMSA has been subjected to a barrage of attacks from the liberal media in cahoots with all sorts of charlatans and agent provocateurs who have been spreading false information about the organisation and its leadership. Indeed this National Congress of the largest trade union on the African continent has confirmed that the Union is run and managed by NUMSA members themselves. NUMSA is indeed worker controlled! The SRWP wishes the newly elected NOBs and the entire Union well in the journey ahead to continue pursuing a revolutionary agenda for a South Africa free of oppression and economic exploitation. Viva metalworkers viva! Forward to socialism! Issued by Motebang Oupa Ralake, General Secretary, SRWP, 28 July 2022

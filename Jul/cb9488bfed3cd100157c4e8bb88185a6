DA extends condolences following horrific KZN tavern killings 10 July 2022 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) extends its heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost loved ones during a horrific shooting incident at a Pietermaritzburg tavern last night. According to reports, armed men stormed the tavern, shooting 12 people. Tragically, four lives were lost and eight more people have been seriously injured. The DA is deeply disturbed by the level of violence in our province. We are equally concerned by the attacks being carried out in places such as taverns, which appears to be a new trend. The question is: What kind of society have we become, that criminals are taking innocent lives on a daily basis? And why are there no consequences for the vast majority of these murderers? The DA expects KZN’s SAPS Commissioner and Acting Community Safety MEC, Jomo Sibiya to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated so that this hateful crime can be investigated without delay. This must include the involvement of a specialized unit dedicated to ensuring that these criminals are soon behind bars. The lawlessness within our province must be stopped. KZN’s people can no longer live in fear. Issued by Sharon Hoosen, DA KZN Spokesperson on Community Safety and Liaison, 10 July 2022

The Presidency refutes Adv Teffo's baseless tirade The Presidency has noted and strongly refutes the false claims made by Advocate Malesela Teffo that The Presidency is behind his alleged intimidation and subsequent decision to withdraw from the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial.The Presidency finds these unsubstantiated and baseless claims mischievous and harmful to the standing of the Office of the President.The Presidency does not participate in criminal investigations or trials and is not involved in any perceived or actual harassment of Adv. Teffo.As an Officer of the Court and a professional in the legal fraternity, Adv. Teffo must appreciate the level of veracity that is necessary to support such claims about any institution or individual.The Presidency espouses the values of our Constitution and cherishes the protection, safety and justice for all.  Issued by Vincent Magwenya, Spokesperson to the President, 13 July 2022

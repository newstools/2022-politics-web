President Ramaphosa’s renewed call for Black Economic Empowerment points to lack of political capital 21 July 2022 President Ramaphosa's renewed call for using Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) as a core mechanism for bringing about economic transformation lacks political capital and reinforces the blame-shifting politics that has become characteristic of a waning ANC government. In opening the inaugural Black Industrialists and Exporters Conference on Wednesday in Sandton, Ramaphosa said, among other things, that legislation must be amended to promote government's preferential procurement programme to benefit black entrepreneurs Ramaphosa's speech was riddled with blame-shifting and completely ignored the destructive consequences of 28 years under a poor ANC government, which has the country's economy teetering on the edge due to state capture, the bankruptcy of public enterprises, like Eskom, and the collapse of municipal service delivery while unemployment is rampant. Sustainable economic growth and empowerment can only be achieved when there is investor confidence in the country, and tenders and appointments are made solely on merit. The redistribution of wealth promotes the redistribution of poverty. The FF Plus strives for establishing a multiparty coalition government after the 2024 elections, which will be free of the ANC's corruption and blame-shifting. South Africa deserves better than the ANC. Issued by Jaco Mulder, FF Plus MP and chief spokesperson: Trade, Industry and Competition, 21 July 2022

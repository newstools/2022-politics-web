Cape Forum repeats call for policing referendum 19 July 2022 Police minister Bheki Cele’s criticism against the Western Cape government’s call for policing powers to be devolved to the province confirms Cape Forum’s belief that a referendum should be called to allow the citizens of the province a say in the matter. Cape Forum is a newly formed civil society organisation with its main goal to have state functions, including policing, housing, fisheries and transport passed down to the province, municipalities and communities due to national government’s failure in delivering these services. Minister Cele is correct in stating that it would be “unconstitutional” to have a provincial police service. That is precisely why Cape Forum has approached the Western Cape government with an offer to assist in establishing legal certainty on whether current legislation allows for a provincial referendum to be held. If confirmed by a court of law, Cape Forum would encourage the provincial cabinet to immediately call a referendum on the devolution of policing powers to the province. This would not only serve to test the people of the Western Cape’s support for such a move, but it is also aimed at ensuring that the province receives its fair share of taxpayers’ money spent on policing. We have already received a positive response that Premier Winde and some of his senior provincial cabinet members will in due course confirm a date to meet with us.

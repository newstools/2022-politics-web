FROM: KGANKI MATABANE THE BBC STATEMENT ON COMPANIES     AND      INDIVIDUALS IMPLICATED IN THE ZONDO COMMISSION REPORT 14 January 2021 The Black Business Council (BBC) strongly believes that the law should take its course on all who have been found to have played a part in procurement corruption in the Zondo Commission Report, without fear or favour. This should apply to all individuals, companies, whether big, small, black- or white-owned, local or global. Furthermore, those who have paid back the money, should still face the full might of the law. "The BBC is of the view that companies such as Bain & Co, should be blacklisted and be prevented from doing business with the state. Reimbursing the State and getting off scot-free makes a mockery of our legal system and does not constitute sufficient punishment for wrongdoing. Repayment of R200m with interest is a clear admission of guilt by Bain" said Kganki Matabane, CEO of the BBC. Anti-apartheid activist and former British MP Mr. Peter Hain has called on the UK government to bar Bain from doing business in that country by freezing all its contracts with the government, subject to Bain's co-operation with the NPA in SA. What is stopping the South African government from doing the same? "There should be serious consequences and accountability for private sector companies that enabled looting and state capture. We urge those that are defending Bain to be consistent and stop legitimising wrongdoing." concluded Matabane. Justice must be done, regardless of the consequences.

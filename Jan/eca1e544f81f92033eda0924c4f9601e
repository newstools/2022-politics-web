Farm murders: DA saddened by the killing of 70 year old Howick farmer 25 January 2022 The Democratic Alliance in Mooi-uMngeni is deeply saddened by the brutal attack and killing of 70 year old Hedley James Brown, a farmer from Howick in the Midlands who was found dead yesterday morning. We would like to send our heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of Mr Brown. According to reports, his body was found lying outside the house and tied up with assault wounds to the face and two stab wounds in the back. We call on the South African Police Services to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book. We need to send a strong message to the perpetrators of these crimes. Howick has become a hotspot for these heinous murders and little to nothing has been done by both the Provincial and National governments. Our farming communities are not safe. In the past, we had asked that they deploy the necessary resources to protect our farmers and farmworkers. To date, the provincial government has paid lip service to the safety of rural and farming communities. The DA has consistently been fighting for the farming community at a Provincial and National level. In December 2020, through our representatives at the Legislature, we wrote to 10 high profile international human rights organisations to bring the plight of our farmers and farmworkers to their attention. The DA will continue to fight for the safety of farming communities, police visibility in rural areas, resources needed to deal with these crimes and for the justice system to give perpetrators the harsh sentencing that they deserve.

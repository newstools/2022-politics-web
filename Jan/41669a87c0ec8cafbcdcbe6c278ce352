IFP Statement on the Killing of Speaker of Amajuba District Municipality 29 January 2022 It is with sadness and shock that the IFP announces the tragic news that Member of the IFP National Council and Speaker of the AmaJuba District Municipality, Cllr Reginald Bhekumndeni Ndima (58), was shot and killed by unknown assailants last night, as he was arriving at his home in Newcastle. Cllr Ndima was elected Speaker of AmaJuba District Municipality after the 2021 Local Government Elections. Details at this stage are unclear. The IFP therefore expects the SAPS and related law enforcement agencies to investigate this matter with urgency, including the activation of the 72-hour swift response for these matters. Cllr Ndima was a humble and responsible servant of the people, who diligently dedicated his life to public service. His untimely death is a loss for the people he served with integrity for 15 years as a Councillor. The IFP is deeply shocked by this news and extremely worried about the continued killing of public representatives, especially Councillors, without justice ever being served. The absence of successful investigations and prosecutions in the spate of the killings of Councillors in KwaZulu-Natal emboldens the criminal syndicates to continue on their killing spree with impunity. The IFP leadership will visit the Ndima family tomorrow Sunday, 30 January 2022, at 15h00 in Newcastle; whereafter after a full statement on the matter will be communicated. The IFP extends its deepest and sincerest condolences to the Ndima family and the people of AmaJuba District. Issued by Mkhuleko Hlengwa, IFP National Spokesperson, 29 January 2022

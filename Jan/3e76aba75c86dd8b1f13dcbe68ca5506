DA WC welcomes progress to get trains back on track 09 January 2022 On Friday, myself and councillors from the City of Cape Town conducted an oversight visit of the reopening of the Southern Line to Simons Town. We welcome this milestone in ensuring that residents are able to use to this critical mode of transport. For the past three months, the Southern Line has faced immense pressures that have jeopardised its operational capacity. Recently, on the 5th of January, a stoning incident on a brand-new People’s Train caused R20 000 worth of damage. This is a mere chapter in the saga of vandalism and theft that has plagued the rail sector. In my capacity as Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Transport and Public Works, I will invite Prasa to give an update on the railways, station repairs and the functionality of all lines in the province. We are acutely aware of the constant struggles commuters have had to endure in attempting to use rail transport and share their frustrations. In many circumstances no alternatives were given by PRASA, which resulted in residents having to use more expensive transport alternatives in order to get to work. It’s paramount that trains run on time and reliably, as it forms the backbone of not only the Western Cape’s transport infrastructure, but also that of our country’s. Trains remain the most affordable and cost-effective method of transport. As the DA in the Western Cape, we will continue to monitor the rolling out of new trains and the fulfilment of PRASA’s promises of safe and reliable public transport for all residents.

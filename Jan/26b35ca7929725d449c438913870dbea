MINISTER DE LILLE MUST ACT NOW! Statement by Executive Mayor Gesie van Deventer 25 January 2022 In the heart of the Stellenbosch CBD lies 18 Mark Street. This historic property belongs to the National Department of Public Works. It has stood empty & neglected for years. Not only is the building dilapidated & the erf completely run-down, but the notorious property also attracts many illicit activities. This is a massive safety & security hazard for our residents & something we simply cannot stand for. This evening, 26 January 2022, Stellenbosch Municipal Law Enforcement together with Mayco member for Protection Services, Councilor Rikus Badenhorst, conducted yet another operation on the property at 18 Mark Street.The municipality has repeatedly engaged with the department on this property, notices have been issued on the property in terms of our Problem Property Bylaw and regular Law Enforcement operations are conducted on the premises to clear the building of criminals and drug dealers.

We call on Minister De Lille to make good on her promises and to act now. Let’s fix 18 Mark Street. Statement issued by Stellenbosch Municipality via Twitter, 26 January 2021

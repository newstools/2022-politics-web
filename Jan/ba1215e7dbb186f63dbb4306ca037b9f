Media release by Premier Alan Winde on the appointment of Anroux Marais as acting Minister of Community Safety 24 January 2022 Today I have appointed Western Cape Minister of Cultural Affairs and Sport, Anroux Marais, as the acting Minister of Community Safety. Minister Marais will ensure that the Department of Community Safety continues to respond to communities’ safety needs and to drive our important safety priorities. I know there have been many questions raised around the nature of the allegations which resulted in the suspension of Minister Fritz. It is always my preference to be open and transparent with residents of the province and the media. In this case, however, noting specific requests by the complainants for confidentiality, the seriousness of the allegations made and the rights of all parties to a fair and unprejudiced investigation into the veracity of the claims made, I may not do so at this stage. I assure you that I am treating this matter with the seriousness it deserves and I will provide further updates as soon as I am able to. Finally, I have noted many rumours and reports by individuals who wish to politicise this matter. I will not play politics with the wellbeing of people and would like to urge anyone who views this matter as a political football to show restraint, especially in consideration of the requests made by the complainants and the rights of all to a fair process.

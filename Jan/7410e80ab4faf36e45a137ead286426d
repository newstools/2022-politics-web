Alfred Duma mayor covering up suspicious accident? 26 January 2022 The DA will write to the Municipal Manager of Alfred Duma Municipality, Sibusiwe Ngiba, to demand that a full report on the alleged accident involving the Mayor, Cllr Zama Joel Sibisi, and the mayoral car be tabled at the next council sitting. Serious allegations exist that the mayor uses municipal vehicles, bodyguards and chase cars for personal purposes and outside the area of the municipality. During one such alleged event, an accident occurred and there are now questions of whether the journey was unauthorised and why the accident was not reported to councillors immediately. The accident allegedly happened a month ago. If it is found that the use of the mayoral vehicles and other resources was unauthorised, then IFP Mayor Sibisi must be held personally liable for all costs involved including but not limited to: Repairs to the vehicle or vehicles, The costs of all staff including bodyguards during such an unauthorised journey, The costs of all expenses such as fuel and wear and tear on these vehicles. The DA is fundamentally opposed to any use of municipal resources such as vehicles and bodyguards. Chris Pappas, the DA mayor in the uMngeni municipality, has already set the example that must be followed by other mayors. The DA notes the late communique issued yesterday by the Office of the Municipal Manager – a month after the incident. However, the DA insists on a full and impartial investigation into the incident.

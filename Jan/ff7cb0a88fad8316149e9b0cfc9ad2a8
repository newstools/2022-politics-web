MEDIA STATEMENT ON THE DEATH OF MR FRANK DUTTON 20 JANUARY 2022 The National Prosecuting Authority is deeply saddened by the passing of Mr Frank Dutton, one of South Africa’s fearless warriors for justice and the rule of law. Mr Dutton dedicated his life to this noble cause. Mr Dutton was working for the NPA’s Investigating Directorate (ID), after his work at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry. He was a seasoned and highly skilled investigator who worked for SAPS for 40 years. He had also served as the first commander of the Directorate for Special Operations (DSO) in the NPA, popularly known as the Scorpions. Mr Dutton played leading roles in complex investigations in South Africa and many other countries. He is a recipient of the Order of Baobab in Gold, awarded by the President of South Africa in 2012 for his policing work, both locally and internationally. Mr Dutton’s work investigating “cold” cases from the apartheid era, paved the way for the reopening of the inquests into the deaths in detention of Ahmed Timol and Neil Aggett, as well as the indictment relating to the murder of Nokuthula Simelane. The NDPP Adv Shamila Batohi said: “Mr Dutton’s passing is a huge loss to the fight for justice and accountability, and to our country. However, justice and the rule of law will prevail.” Mr Dutton is an inspiration and his legacy will inspire all of us as we continue the huge task of responding to the findings and recommendations of the State Capture Commission report, and holding those responsible for corruption in our country, to account. The NDPP sends her condolences to his family. Statement issued by Adv Mthunzi Mhaga, NPA Spokesperson on behalf of the National Director of Public Prosecutions, 20 January 2022

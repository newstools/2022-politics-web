DEPARTMENT OF BASIC EDUCATION 10 January 2022 Dear Sir/Madam TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN The Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 (Act No. 4 of 2013) (the POPIA) came into effect on I July 2021. The DBE recognizes that section 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, provides that everyone has the right to privacy. This right to privacy includes a right to protection against the unlawful collection, retention, dissemination and use of personal information. In order to comply with the provisions of the POPIA, the usual practice of publishing the national senior certificate (NSC) results on public platforms (media platforms) will not occur for 2021. As was also the practice in previous years all learners will be required to obtain their statement of results from the schools they attended. In this way every learner's personal information with regards to the outcome of their national senior certificate exam will be protected.

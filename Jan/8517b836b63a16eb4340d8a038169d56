DA intensifies its call for the Moerane report to be implemented 29 January 2022 The DA in KwaZulu-Natal is saddened to learn of yet another political killing in just over a week, this time in Amajuba district. The Speaker of Amajuba district, Cllr R.M Ndima was reportedly gunned down in the early hours of this morning. We would like to send our heartfelt condolences to his family and colleagues. We would also like to reiterate our call to the Provincial leadership to prioritise the recommendations of the Moerane commission to prevent further bloodshed. The job of councillors is to serve communities, it is now up to the the Premier, Sihle Zikalala and CoGTA MEC, Sipho Hlomuka to ensure that they are able to do their duty without being in constant fear.

Success: Court rules matric results may be published 18 January 2022 AfriForum welcomes the court ruling by Judge Millar today in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria that granted the organisation’s order unchanged. The organisation is confident that the matric results can be published on Thursday 20 January and that former matriculants will be able to get their results in the newspapers and on media platforms. “It is in the public interest that this information is shared on public platforms and that is one of the reasons why we brought this application. We are delighted that the court agreed with us in this argument,” says Natasha Venter, Manager of Education Rights at AfriForum.

ANC in Legislature demands immediate, full explanation from Premier for suspending MEC Fritz 23 January 2022 The ANC in the Western Cape Legislature has learned through the news media of Premier Allan Winde’s decision to immediately suspend the Western Cape MEC for Community Safety, Albert Fritz. So far, no reasons have been given for this extraordinary measure. However, the fact that the MEC, who is also the DA’s provincial leader, has been suspended in a most un-Alan Winde-like move, is a clear indication that something seriously is wrong. “We demand a full an immediate explanation of the allegations against MEC Fritz. In the interest of transparency, open governance, and his responsibility to the people of the province, we demand the Premier comes clean and plays open cards with us.  We don’t want to speculate on the reasons, we want the truth, and we want it now,” said the Leader of the Opposition, Cameron Dugmore, in a statement.

DA petition against Eskom price hike gains 30 000 signatures in 5 days  25 January 2022 Note to Editors: Please find attached soundbite by Kevin Mileham MP. The DA’s petition to oppose Eskom’s application to hike the price of electricity by 20.5% has gained more than 30 000 signatures within the space of five days. The DA rejects Eskom’s attempts to raise the price of electricity at a time when the cost of living is on the rise in South Africa. The cost of food, accommodation and transport continue to spike and an electricity tariff hike will only contribute to the financial distress faced by poor households in particular. The overwhelming reaction to the DA’s petition highlights how callous Eskom’s application truly is. Eskom can barely keep the lights on, and to expect South Africans to pay more money for an unreliable service is completely out of touch. We are encouraged by the thousands of South Africans who have voiced their objections to this outrageous increase. And we urge more South Africans to add their signatures by signing our petition using the following link: notoincreases.co.za Issued by Kevin Mileham, DA Shadow Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, 25 January 2022

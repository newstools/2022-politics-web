EFF statement on Ramaphosa and Ministers’ serial refusal to answer Parliament questions 25 January 2022 The EFF condemns President Ramaphosa and his cabinet for their serial refusal to answer parliamentary questions. This is a direct attack and violation of the constitution which they not only have sworn to respect, but hypocritically parade themselves as its defenders. In 2021, the President and cabinet did not answer 175 Questions for Written Reply, 57 of which came from the EFF benches. According to Rule 145. subsection 5(a) of National Assembly. "A questions for written reply must be replied to within 10 working days. provided that the responsible Minister may in writing request the Speaker for an extension not exceeding a further 10 working day on good cause shown." As things stand this rule has been undermined by Ramaphosa and his cabinet with impunity. The central implication is that they refuse to be accountable which is a direct attack on South Africa's Constitution. The following is the breakdown of all those who have defied the Constitution and rules of parliament by refusing to answer questions: PRESIDENT 4 AGRICULTURE, LAND REFORM AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT 24 BASIC EDUCATION 5 COMMUNICATIONS AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES 8 COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE AND TRADITIONAL AFFAIRS 3 DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS 25 FINANCE 7 HIGHER EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION 4 HUMAN SETTLEMENTS 17 JUSTICE AND CORRECTIONAL SERVICES 7 MINERAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY 7 POLICE 9 PUBLIC ENTERPRISES 11 PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTARTION 7 PUBLIC WORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE 5 TOURISM 14 TRANSPORT 3 MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY 5 WATER AND SANITATION 10 We call on Ramaphosa to show leadership and answer all 4 of the outstanding questions with immediate effect. In addition, he must instruct all his cabinet ministers to provide answers to all outstanding questions with immediate effect; immediate effect means 24 hours. Minister Ronald Lamola must drop his long sell-out face in shame for attacking the constitution by not answering 7 questions. He goes around portraying himself as the cheerleader of the constitution but fails to abide by a simple principle of accountability. Before Minister Sisulu finds time to write long public opinion pieces about serving the people of South Africa, she must do the basic thing and answer questions from their elected public representative in parliament. Moreover, am extraordinary step must be taken in relation to Ministers Mmamoloko Kubayi with 17 outstanding questions, Thoko Didiza with 24 outstanding questions, and Thandi Modise with 25 outstanding questions. These ministers must either be removed from cabinet or lose 6 months of their salaries each for showing absolute disdain to the constitution. It is high time that Ramaphosa and his cabinet respect the Constitutional principle of accountability. Parliament is the central constitutional mechanism for holding the executive accountable; refusal to answer its questions is outright disloyalty to the constitution. The EFF will therefore not allow any of these cabinet members to get away with defying the Constitution. We will be prepared to take legal action to attain a declaratory order that the President and/or cabinet ministers have violated the Constitution by not answering parliament questions and initiate Section 89 impeachment proceedings.

Cape Town City Hall to be officially handed over to Parliament 28 January 2022 The Executive Mayor of Cape Town Geordin Hill-Lewis will on Monday, 31 January, officially hand over the Cape Town City Hall to Parliament’s Presiding Officers, the Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, and the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Mr Amos Masondo. The hand-over follows a decision by the Presiding Officers to use the City Hall as an alternative off-site venue for hosting the State of the Nation Address after a devastating fire that destroyed Parliament’s buildings, including the National Assembly (NA) and sections of the Old Assembly Chamber on 2 January. The State of the Nation Address is a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament and President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the address on 10 February 2022 at 19:00. After the hand-over, the City Hall will be declared the Parliament of South Africa precinct. Issued by Moloto Mothapo on behalf on Parliament, 28 January 2022

NPA and State Capture Commission of Inquiry solidify collaboration efforts 10 May 2022 The NPA and the State Capture commission Secretariat continue to engage to strengthen relations and agree on concrete areas of engagement. In this regard, the Commission will continue to do what it can to assist the NPA and Investigating Directorate (ID) to carry out their mandates as the Commission approaches the end of its term. Fruitful discussions on the ID’s need for better access to Commission information continue to take place. Both institutions agree that the amendment of the Commission Regulation 11 on the 28 July 2020, has paved the way for better collaboration between the Commission and the ID. This needs to be optimised and both institutions appreciate the urgency of the matter. The Commission will continue to grant the NPA access to evidence gathered by the Commission in accordance with the law to ensure successful investigations and prosecutions of matters arising out of the Commission’s work. The two entities are committed to ensuring a seamless transition phase of the Commission’s work, to the extent that they may translate into criminal cases, asset forfeiture recoveries, or other sanctions which the courts will deem fit. Ending impunity for high-level corruption and state capture cases is a priority for the country. This requires enhanced collaboration between a number of stakeholders, while respecting their respective roles and mandates. The ID has so far declared 82 investigations and enrolled 20 cases and a majority arising from the work of the commission with 65 accused persons. The Commission has issued its detailed 4th report and its tenure has been extended to the 15 June 2022, with an expectation of further reports. Concrete progress towards accountability in the coming months will assist in safeguarding the rule of law in South Africa.

If Nathi Mthethwa does not respect the Afrikaans Taalmonument, the DA will take over and protect it 28 May 2022 During this morning's historic “Wys Jou STaal” protest concert in Paarl, the DA called on ANC Minister Nathi Mthethwa to hand over management of the Afrikaanse Taalmonument to the DA-controlled Western Cape rather than changing the Monument's name. We also welcome the fact that the Western Cape Minister of Arts and Culture, Anroux Marais, has already made a formal request to Mthethwa in this regard. Several senior DA leaders also strongly objected to Mthetwa's proposed name change during the meeting of the management of the Afrikaanse Taalmonument. We reject the ANC's proposal with the contempt it deserves, because it will strip the Monument of all significance. In collaboration with some of our country's greatest artists, the DA also presented a historic protest concert. We thank the hundreds of people who attended the concert as well as our demonstration. The concert made it clear that the Afrikaans-speaking community is united with the DA against the ANC's attack on the Afrikaanse Taalmonument. The DA will not rest until we have repelled this insane ANC plan. Issued by Tertuis Simmers, DA Provincial Chairperson, Western Cape, 28 May 2022

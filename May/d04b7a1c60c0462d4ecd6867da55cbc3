Security is critical to ensure deadlines are met to reopen Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg hospital  9 May 2022 The Democratic Alliance is disappointed that the Accident and Emergency Unit at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital (CMJH) is not fully reopened this week, but will only accept patients in a phased manner, mostly because the CT Scanner has not yet been repaired. This highlights the need for proper security as the Scanner was vandalised despite R40 million spent annually on security at the hospital. It appears that there are criminal syndicates that could still sabotage the reopening of other hospital departments. Health Minister Joe Phaahle failed to address the security issue in his announcement this morning at the hospital, but it is vital that cast-iron guarantees are given that the deadlines are met for Obstetrics & Gynaecology to open in March next year, Paediatrics in July, Surgery in October, and Internal Medicine in November 2023. The public and the private sector need to work efficiently together to ensure that there are not further delays in getting at the hospital departments up and running. If this does not occur, hundreds of patients will continue to suffer at hospitals like Helen Joseph which cannot cope with the flood of CMJH patients.

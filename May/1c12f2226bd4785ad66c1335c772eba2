GOOD condemns disgusting racist incident at Stellenbosch University 17 May 2022 The GOOD party condemns in the strongest terms the racist incident which occurred at the University of Stellenbosch over the weekend. On May the 15th, a white student – identified as Theuns du Toit – broke into a black student's residence and urinated on his books and laptop. Since news of the event broke, du Toit has been suspended by the University. Calls have grown for his expulsion. This isn't the first accusation of racism at the Stellenbosch campus. Since this story the floodgates have opened; with many students of colour coming forward to describe racist discrimination at the hands of fellow students. Residence heads have used the K-word, some students have worn blackface, while several house initiation ceremonies have been used as opportunities to discriminate. Too many incidents have been swept under the rug without consequence. If the University of Stellenbosch wants to be part of a united South Africa, then it must address the history of racist incidents that have occurred on its grounds. The 1994 generation fought tooth and nail to secure a non-racial future for us all. As a rainbow nation, we must stand united against acts of racism, so our institutions are inclusive spaces. GOOD calls on the University of Stellenbosch to makes its campus a space of racial tolerance, so that students of colour feel free to pursue their education.

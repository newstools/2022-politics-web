Swift action stops fire at Steve Biko Hospital 30 May 2022 I am relieved that swift action with fire extinguishers put out a fire in the early hours of this morning at temporary structures of the Steve Biko Hospital. According to the Gauteng Health Department, 18 patients and one corpse were removed from nearby structures outside the main building, and there were no casualties. This incident highlights the continuing hazard of fires at our health facilities, as well as the value of trained staff and equipment to prevent a fire from spreading. This is the fifth fire in seven years at Gauteng health facilities. I hope that a speedy investigation reveals the causes of the fire, unlike other investigations into fires which are never released and lead to suspicions of a cover-up. I am continuing to press for the release of the investigation reports on the Bank of Lisbon fire in September 2018, and the fire at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital in April last year.

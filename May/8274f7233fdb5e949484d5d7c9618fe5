NDZ and the capital: by George, she's got it! 11 May 2022 I am pleased to announce that the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, finally found the capital city of South Africa, almost two years after she had no clue and failed to come back with an answer to a parliamentary question submitted by the DA. Minister Dlamini-Zuma in a follow-up written parliamentary reply received yesterday, indicated that Pretoria, situated in the municipality of Tshwane, is the capital city. Although, theoretically, South Africa has two other capital cities – Cape Town as the legislative capital and Bloemfontein (Mangaung) as the judicial capital – one out of three is good enough for this Minister. It is a pass in the education system under the ANC. We hope that Minister Dlamini-Zuma's study of South Africa's geography in the past two years has opened her eyes to the countless municipalities in the country that are currently crippled under ANC rule as Tshwane was during the time of the question, 5 June 2020. In the meantime, more and more voters who do not have the luxury of time to wait for the Minister to come round, have come to realise that the only way to better services, a stronger economy and a prosperous future is by voting for a DA government.

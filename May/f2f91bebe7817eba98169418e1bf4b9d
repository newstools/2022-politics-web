Cape Forum welcomes Hlophe judgment  6 May 2022 The Cape judiciary deserves better than to be led by a Judge President who continues to find himself mired in a case of gross misconduct. Therefore the process of impeachment against Judge John Hlophe, following a finding in this regard by the Judicial Service Commission, should continue without any further delay. The Cape Forum welcomes the dismissal by a full bench of the Gauteng Division of the High Court of Hlophe’s application for a review of the JSC’s finding. “Almost fifteen years have passed since Hlophe’s attempt to influence two colleagues in favour of former President Jacob Zuma. In the same way that Zuma has done over the years in respect of serious cases against him Hlophe, too, has done everything to delay action being taken against him. To see him judging over important cases undoubtedly impacts negatively on the credibility of the Cape judiciary,” says Heindrich Wyngaard, Executive Chairperson of the Cape Forum. The establishment of its own independent judiciary for the Western Cape is one of Cape Forum’s ten focus areas. Issued by Chanté Kelder, Media Relations Officer, Cape Forum, 6 May 2022

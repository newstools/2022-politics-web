COSATU Free State condemns utterances by Moqhaka Mayor 25 May 2022 The Congress of Trade Unions in the Free State has learned with shock the utterances made by Moqhaka Executive Mayor Comrade Motloheloa ‘Toy’ Mokatsane on social media. The mayor was caught on camera calling residents by the k-word while addressing them outside the Viljoenskroon Magistrate’s Court. We have further noted the statement issued by the office of the Executive Mayor sending out an apology for these remarks, which in turn, is clear admission that these utterances were indeed made by Mayor Mokatsane himself. There is absolutely no justification for such comments. Such remarks will remain unacceptable to us irrespective of who is guilty of making them. The use of the k-word remains unlawful and demeaning to Africans. Transgressors of this act must therefore face the consequences for their actions. Following the incident, we urge the state and the leadership of the African National Congress to deal with this matter with the seriousness it deserves. This is becoming a common occurrence. Leaders are taking to podiums and addressing our people with utter unprofessionalism and lack of preparedness. This leaves much to be desired from what is expected from our leadership and shows less regard for our people. It cannot be that the mayor has speechwriters on the payroll of the municipality who are equipped with the skills to help him address our people with the professionalism and dignity they deserve. He cannot individually decide to make such reckless remarks on any occasion. Such behavior is extremely irresponsible because it is in these situations where leaders make unrealistic and impractical commitments to the community. This pattern discredits our leaders as they lose trust and credibility in the community. We would like to appeal to our leaders to prepare adequately before addressing any gathering however small it may be. The struggle continues! Issued by COSATU Free State, 25 May 2022

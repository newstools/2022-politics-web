EFF condemns the murder of Al-Jazeera journalist Shereen Abu Aqleh by Israeli forces 12 May 2022 The EFF condemns the deliberate and premeditated killing of Al-Jazeera joumalist Shereen Abu Aqleh in the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, at the hands of Israeli Occupying Forces. The continued occupation of Palestine by Israel has led to unspeakable tortures and war crimes, and this is yet another killing which seeks to suppress objective coverage of the crimes of Israel against Palestinian people. Imperialist media entities which seek to distort the deliberate murder of Shereen, suggest that she died in the midst of a conflict between Palestinian freedom fighters and Israeli occupying forces. The truth is that she was shot by a sniper, a clear indication that this was an assassination. The EFF extends its sincere condolences to the family, her colleagues at Al-Jazeera channel, all media professionals and the Palestinian people on the martyrdom of Abu Aqleh. This execution is a heinous crime that violates intemational laws and norms and adds to the several war crimes committed by the Israeli Occupying Forces. We call on the South African government, peace-loving South Africans and the international community to condemn this heinous crime and take practical action to hold the Occupying Forces accountable for their deliberate killing of Abu Aqleh. We all have a responsibility to ensure there is accountability for the continuing crimes against the Palestinian people and journalists. Furthermore, the EFF calls on the South African government to follow the example of progressive governments by severing all diplomatic and trade relations with the Apartheid State of Israel and to expel the Israeli Ambassador from South Africa.

EFF WELCOMES THE ARREST OF THREE SUSPECTS IN THE HILLARY GARDEE CASE Sunday, 08 May 2022 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) welcomes the arrest of three suspects, in the investigation of the brutal murder of Hillary Gardee. After a commitment to make concrete progress on finding the perpetrators in a short period of time. the South African Police Services (SAPS) have not only made good on their promise after the arrest of a suspect on the eve of Hillary's funeral, but have apprehended two more suspects. The family and the EFF will allow the police to continue with their work, and ensure that they are provided with all manner of resources to enhance their investigation. The suspects are unknown at this stage, and will appear at the Nelspruit Magistrate's Court on Monday, 09th of May 2022. The family will be in attendance, and we hope justice will be served to the fullest extent, Considering that the first suspect was apprehended while fleeing and in hiding, the family and the EFF are of the considered view that all the accused must be denied bail, as they are collectively an undeniable flight risk, If we are to send a strong message against the brutal abuse, harassment and killing of women in this country, the appearance of those accused with this heinous crime must be used as an opportunity to show the unity of society against Gender-Based Violence. Statement issued by the EFF, 8 May 2022

Higher Education Committee condemns Stellenbosch University video 17 May 2022 The Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Innovation is appalled and repulsed by the video from last Sunday that captures a student living in the University of Stellenbosch’s Huis Marais Residence urinating on the belongings of a fellow student. The committee unequivocally condemns this act of racism and discrimination and welcomes the suspension and removal of the perpetrator from the university premises. The committee visited the University of Stellenbosch on 16 February 2022 to receive a briefing on the institution’s transformation journey thus far. This incident qualifies the committee’s concern regarding the institution’s state of transformation. The committee charges the university leadership led by Vice-Chancellor Professor Wim de Villiers to ensure that all due disciplinary processes are followed in addressing this dehumanising and totally unacceptable behaviour. The committee also notes the call made by the university’s Student Representative Council (SRC) for overt acts of racism and discrimination to be addressed institutionally. The committee calls upon the university to conclude its investigation of the incident with speed and make its findings public to reassure the country that it strives for an inclusive student community. Justice must prevail for the affected student and the committee charges the university to ensure that they receive the mental health care they need, considering the loathsome ordeal they experienced. The committee calls upon the management of the University of Stellenbosch, the SRC and the student community to forge alliances to build a non-racial and inclusive institution. The committee will be engaging with the university leadership and the Department of Higher Education and Training on this matter.

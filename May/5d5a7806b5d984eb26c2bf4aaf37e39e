Mayor receives report on proactive lifestyle audit of Mayoral Committee members 14 May 2022 I have received the report on a proactive forensic lifestyle audit of the 11 members of the City’s Mayoral Committee (MayCo). I am happy to report that the report did not identify any significant risks or red flags. I am satisfied that the audit was sufficiently invasive to ensure that nothing could be easily hidden. Capetonians can rest assured that our local government respects public money and expects integrity from all members appointed to public office. I am convinced these lifestyle audits should become standard practice for politicians and senior government officials across South Africa, in every level of government. This is the only way we will root out corruption and begin to restore public trust in government. Cape Town is proud to lead by example in doing this now, even though it is not required. This underscores our zero tolerance approach to corruption in Cape Town. If and when it does occur, it will be rooted out and punished without fear or favour. The proactive lifestyle audit was undertaken by two independent firms: Fairbridges Wertheim Becker and FTI Consulting. It investigated 15 items, which were predefined in its terms of reference. These include: - The business interests of MayCo members; - Any unexplainable assets, liabilities, or lifestyle queries; - The immovable property and vehicle ownership of MayCo members; - MayCo members’ employment histories; - Any gifts, donations, discounts, or other income received by MayCo members from persons doing business with the City; - The business interests and employment of members of MayCo members’ families; - The history of MayCo members’ water, rates, and sewerage account payments; and - MayCo members’ linkages to the City’s supply chain management (tender) database. Across all of these terms of reference, and in respect of all eleven MayCo members investigated, no substantial risks were identified. The City of Cape Town is committed to clean governance and scrupulous leadership, and I believe the fact of this investigation, and its results, affirm this.

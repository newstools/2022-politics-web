Rhulani Mathebula will act as Generation Executive as Phillip Dukashe resigns to leave Eskom at the end of the month 9 May 2022 It is with regret that Eskom announces the resignation of Phillip Dukashe, Group Executive for Generation. A true, loyal asset to Eskom and the country, Mr Dukashe’s last day will be on 31 May 2022. In his resignation letter and discussions with Eskom executives, Mr Dukashe has cited the critical need to achieve a balance for the benefit of his health, family and work responsibilities. Phillip leaves behind a competent team to ensure sustainability of the Generation Division. Rhulani Mathebula will act in the interim as the Group Executive for Generation while the recruitment process is initiated. Rhulani is a seasoned Power Station General Manager and had acted as Group Executive Generation prior to Phillip’s appointment. We salute Phillip for his rich legacy of selfless leadership, integrity and excellence in serving Eskom and the country for the past 26 years and for always standing up and doing what is right and honourable. Phillip’s vast institutional knowledge, cross functional skills and sound executive leadership experience created the much-needed stability in the Generation division during his tenure and achieved some significant strides in helping to turn around Generation’s poor performance since his permanent appointment into the position from April 2021.

These brave officers serve as force multipliers, making criminals feel the heat. Together with our partners, we are closing down the space for criminals to duck, dive and hide.” Minister Allen concluded: “My plea to communities is to assist and support all law enforcement agencies, so that we can live without fear, and in a safer and dignified manner.

DA welcomes councillors from the Patriotic Alliance 3 May 2022 Note to editors: Kindly find relevant photos here and here, and sound bite here. At a press conference earlier today, the Democratic Alliance in the Western Cape welcomed members of the Patriotic Alliance from Matzikama to the party. Joined by DA Interim Provincial Leader, Tertuis Simmers, DA Provincial Chair, Jaco Londt and Matzikama Mayor, Councillor Van Der Hoven, they welcomed Councillor Christo Boks and leader of the PA in Matzikama, Mr Brenden Owies, into the fold. Yesterday, councillor Boks went back to his ward, to consult his voters. Their overwhelming response was to give their councillor a mandate to resign from the PA and to join the DA. They indicated that they would prefer the DA to run the Matzikama Municipality, instead of smaller parties who enables the ANC. From across the Western Cape, especially in the rural areas, there is an outpouring of frustration by voters towards smaller parties who have effectively sold out their voters and are enabling the ANC to continue their stunt of poor service delivery where they govern. Because of the DA’s positive track record of good governance and service delivery, especially in vulnerable communities, Councillor Boks and Mr Owies are excited to join the DA. We are confident that they will contribute towards us winning the ward and retaining the Matzikama Municipality, ensuring that good governance continues in Matzikama.

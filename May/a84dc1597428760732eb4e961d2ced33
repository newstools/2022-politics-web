Minister Motsoaledi must release immigration permit report without delay 24 May 2022 Note to Editors: Please find attached soundbites in English and Afrikaans by Adrian Roos MP The DA calls on Minister of Home Affairs, Aaron Motsoaledi, to release the report on the review of immigration permits at Home Affairs without further delay. The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs is scheduled to be briefed by the Minister on the report in less than a week on 31 May and members have not yet received the report, which was initially due to serve in Parliament in March. This report is the product of a Ministerial Committee established to review all permits and visas issued since 2004, including Permanent Residence Permits (PRP), Corporate, Business, Retired, Study visas and Citizenship by naturalisation. In the light of the dismissal of former Chief Director of Permitting, Ronney Marhule, for ‘gross dishonesty’ and ‘non-compliance’ with the Immigration Act the committee needs sufficient time to assess the findings. The approval of immigration permits for unauthorised persons presents a significant risk to state security and any criminal offences in terms of the Immigration Act need to be dealt with decisively. Issued by Adrian Roos, DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, 24 May 2022

DA Western Cape elects provincial Leadership 07 May 2022 At the DA’s Western Cape Provincial Council on Saturday, 7 May 2022, DA delegates from across the province have elected an Interim Provincial Leader and Interim Provincial Deputy Leader. Tertuis Simmers, also the Western Cape Minister for Infrastructure, stood unopposed for the position of Interim Provincial Leader, and Jean-Pierre (JP) Smith was elected as Interim Deputy Provincial Leader, earlier today. Also competing on the Deputy Leader ballot was Megann Goedeman, Wendy Philander and Antionette Steyn. We would like to thank them for taking part in what is fundamental to our democratic processes and we appreciate that you campaigned fairly and in good spirit. The DA in the Western Cape has a proven track record of better service delivery and the announcement made earlier this week, that members of the Patriotic Alliance moved over to the DA, is testament to the trust people have in the way we govern. The newly elected leadership now have the responsibility to ensure that all structures in the party are geared towards spreading the message of our proven successes, not only in our province, but to communities in the rest of the country as well. Our aim is to retain the Western Cape and continue to be the DA’s flagship of good governance, and ultimately contribute to bringing the ANC below 50% in the next National and Provincial Elections in 2024. The DA in the Western Cape wishes to congratulate Tertuis and JP on their election today. We are confident that today brings a new beginning for the DA in the Western Cape and that our new leadership will take the party from strength to strength.

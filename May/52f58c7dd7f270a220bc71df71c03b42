Ward 96 Tshwane votes DA in convincing by-election win 5 May 2022 A convincing by-election win last night in Ward 96, Tshwane is a very encouraging vote of confidence for the DA. The DA sincerely thanks the residents of this Ward who came out yesterday to vote in their numbers to keep this Ward DA. The DA received 44.89% of the vote, nearly 25% more than the nearest candidate. The mandate we have received, to elect our candidate Gé Breytenbach as the new Ward Councillor, means that our ongoing mission to turn the City of Tshwane around and to continue to improve this Ward goes on. The voters of Ward 96 have placed their trust in the DA, and we take this trust very seriously. This by-election victory also bodes well for the DA in the City of Tshwane as a whole. Having a DA Mayor in the City of Tshwane, heading a multi-party coalition government, is indeed proving to be a progressive and positive change for the City. We note that many smaller parties mounted competitive campaigns, and while they did not succeed we hope they will continue to rally behind their new Ward Councillor with the same energy. This is a time for us all to work together in the best interests of the residents. This by-election outcome for the DA comes on the back of other successful by-elections in recent months, and indicates confidence and trust from residents that the DA does indeed get things done.

DA-run uMngeni Municipality passes historic adjustment budget  1 March 2022 The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal congratulates the DA run uMngeni municipality with the  passing of the adjustment budget for the 2021/2022 financial year in uMngeni. The first ever DA governed municipality in KwaZulu-Natal has faced numerous challenges since taking  office which included the issue of the suspended municipal manager, a municipality with skewed priorities with all the basics forgotten and a culture of non-accountability being the norm. Despite these challenges, Mayor Chris Pappas announced a people-centred adjustment budget that includes: R4 million  added to the roads maintenance budget to start a fight against potholes, R1 million set aside for streetlights, R1,2 million to purchase  the plant for the dumpsite and R2,45 million for the procurement of  a new refuse compactor.. The DA is delighted with the adjustment budget that is aimed at covering the basics and getting uMngeni to work again. Issued by Francois Rodgers, DA KZN Leader, 1 March 2022

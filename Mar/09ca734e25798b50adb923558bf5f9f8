DA Rainbow Network condemns LGBTQIA+ erasure in Census 2022 2 March 2022 The Democratic Alliance Rainbow Network (DARN) will submit questions in the National Assembly following the exclusion of intersex and transgender options of identification in the online questionnaire for Statistics SA’s Census 2022. The cisgender-biased heterosexist nature of the census in this form perpetuates the effective erasure of LGBTQIA+ individuals living in South Africa and has far-reaching implications for members of the community. The data collected during a census is used to inform policymaking and planning by the state as well as budget allocations across all spheres of government. In addition to being discriminatory, this exclusion misses an opportunity to better understand the LGBTQIA+ community and to empower the government to advance crucial services to communities that have been excluded from mainstream planning and resource allocation for far too long. The DA will be submitting questions in the National Assembly and will seek to find answers to this unnecessary injustice.

Ukraine: DA calls on SA government to take a stand  3 March 2022 The DA is appalled that South Africa abstained from the UN General Assembly vote condemning Russia last night. This was an opportune time for our government to take a clear and moral stand that would gain them ground. It was also the right thing to do. It is unbelievable that South Africa can have double standards when it comes to human rights and this takes away the last of their claim to moral legitimacy. Abstaining or voting for Russia is a sign that one is complicit or condones a military invasion into Ukraine. We call on South Africa to hold Russia accountable to international law in line with the Geneva Convention and ensure that no weapons on the list of the Lieber Code are used. We further call on South Africa again to use its membership in BRICS to try and engage with Russia to bring about their withdrawal from Ukraine. Blind loyalty draped in historic engagements cannot be a reason for future bound decisions that are life dependent. The South African government still has a chance to make a stand and they must. They must do the right thing. Issued by Darren Bergman, DA Shadow Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, 3 March 2022

DA fully supported resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine 24 March 2022 Yesterday the 144th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) adopted by consensus a resolution stating that "the ongoing Russian use of force against Ukraine is a violation of the Charter of the United Nations, including the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity". See the full resolution here. As the DA representative in the South African delegation to the IPU, I fully supported this motion. The DA's stance on the war in Ukraine is clear: We believe that the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin is an act of war for which there is no justification and we condemn it in the strongest terms. Yet, despite the DA's support for the resolution, the ANC and EFF rejected the motion. It is important to note that it was only South Africa and Belarus that rejected the resolution outright. It is now crystal clear that the ANC and the EFF are denying the realities of this war and refuse to rcognise Russia for the aggressor that it is. The ANC and EFF must hang their heads in shame. They are on the wrong side of history. I have approached different delegations as well as the President of the IPU to put forward our position. The ANC and EFF's decision to support Putin's murderous campaign in Ukraine is a moral failure on their part, not on South Africans'. The DA will remain on the right side of history and continue to condemn this war when and wherever we can. Issued by Annelie Lotriet, Chairperson of the DA Parliamentary Caucus, 24 March 2022

DA deeply disturbed by alleged rape in police station 31 March 2022 The DA in KwaZulu-Natal is deeply disturbed by reports in the media of the alleged rape of a woman in a police station in KwaHlabisa. It is alleged that when she sought help, one of the police officers started harassing her, demanding sex. Later, while still on the premises, the officer allegedly raped her, threatening to shoot her with his service pistol should she scream or report the case. The victim made an appeal for help through a local community radio station. As much as the DA in KZN is happy with the swift action of MEC of Social Development in this case, we believe that there needs to be more interventions from social development within areas that have high numbers of gender-based violence (GBV). The scourge of GBV in our province is still a very long way from being dealt with properly. The 3rd quarter crime statistics in our province illustrate this clearly with 2 066 people raped in our province during this three month period. The DA reiterates that the provincial government needs to prioritise victim support units in police stations. They need to be adequately equipped to deal with victims and police officers need to all receive GBV training. To take advantage of a vulnerable and traumatised woman is not only horrific but also speaks to a culture of impunity and aggression.

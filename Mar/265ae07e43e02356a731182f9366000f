DA refers Albert Fritz report to the Federal Legal Commission  1 March 2022 The DA has taken note of the release of the independent report into allegations against Albert Fritz, as well as the action taken by the Western Cape Premier Alan Winde today. The DA Federal Executive has this morning resolved to give Mr Fritz 24 hours to supply reasons as to why he should not be suspended from caucus and party activities and the matter has been referred to the DA’s Federal Legal Commission. Now that the report into the allegations against Mr Fritz has been concluded, the DA can take the necessary action. The DA takes the matter of sexual impropriety, sexual abuse and sexual assault very seriously and will not hesitate to take swift and severe action when these matters arise. The DA is also very aware of the responsibility to protect the victims and ensure that they do not suffer secondary abuse as a result of reporting allegations of abuse and assault.

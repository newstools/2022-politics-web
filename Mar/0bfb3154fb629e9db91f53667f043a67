On Today’s Judgement in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court 4 March 2022 There is tremendous relief within the whole Zulu Nation following Justice Madondo’s judgement today. We are grateful he has laid to rest any argument that the King was not properly identified by the Royal Family as the rightful heir to the throne, and has made it very clear that His Majesty King Misuzulu kaZwelithini is indeed the undisputed successor to his father, King Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu. We trust that this will open the way for His Majesty our King to finally be coronated, as this is a legal formality. As Justice Madondo has confirmed, the King is already the de facto King of the Zulu Nation, as I have always insisted. I personally feel gratified that we may now see the stability that our nation has so longed for since the departure of His Majesty our late King almost a year ago. This has been a painful time for the Royal Family and for the nation. We look forward to restored unity under the reign of His Majesty our King. I appeal to the Nation to pray for His Majesty, because he is taking over a great responsibility. The matters of the late King’s estate and will shall be dealt with in accordance with today’s judgement. We wish to thank the Deputy Judge President, Justice Madondo, for his wisdom, fairness and great care in judging this matter. Issued by Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Traditional Prime Minister to the Zulu Monarch and Nation, 4 March 2022

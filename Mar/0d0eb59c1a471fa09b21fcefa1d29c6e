Solidarity submitted warrants after Denel’s failure to pay R90 million for salaries  9 March 2022 Solidarity today submitted warrants of execution to the value of around R90 million to the sheriff, after Denel failed to pay R90 million in salaries to Solidarity members in terms of a court order. Solidarity contends that despite financial pressure Denel cannot simply fall back on the excuse that there is no money. According to Solidarity, funds that are available must be mobilised and prioritised if Denel does not want to be accused of deliberate contempt of a court order. “What Denel is currently doing amounts to a total failure to fulfil its duties right across the board: decision-making is slow; implementation hardly ever takes place, and where decisions are made and people want to implement them, the necessary funds are not mobilised,” Derek Mans, Defence and Aviation Sector Coordinator at Solidarity explained. “It is a crying shame that we have to constantly approach the courts to force Denel to start doing the right thing with the necessary funds and as soon as possible. If we don’t do so, the future of our members is at risk.” Denel had until 8 March to pay the outstanding salaries of about R90 million to Solidarity members. This follows after the Labour Court earlier this year ordered the payout of salaries. Solidarity points out that for more than two years some of the employees had to make do with partial or no salary payments from Denel. “It is unacceptable that ordinary workers have to forfeit their livelihoods simply because of the ineptitude and incompetence of this company’s top management. This is intolerable and must be opposed. If Denel does not want to pay, we will have its assets seized. After all, Denel has already taken way too much from our members,” Mans concluded.

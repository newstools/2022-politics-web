Health MEC blames vandalism for delay in opening casualty at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital 8 March 2022 Gauteng Health MEC Nomathemba Mokgethi has blamed vandalism for the delay in reopening the Accident and Emergency Unit at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital (CMJH). She was responding today to my questions for oral reply at a sitting of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. According to Mokgethi, they are awaiting the handover of the A & E Unit from the contractors as they had to replace what was vandalised. The Unit will then be cleaned and made ready for patients which she hopes will occur before the end of this month. Another ward is being prepared for adult psychiatric patients as the previous ward was in the fire-damaged area. Previously the MEC had indicated that the A & E Unit would be re-opened on 14 March. I am astonished that vandalism has occurred when the Department spends R40 million a year on security for the hospital. It appears that this vandalism is connected to the reported theft of copper pipes, electrical cables and electrical distribution boards. Meanwhile, other hospitals are struggling to cope with hundreds of casualty patients that should be treated at CMJH. A full investigation is needed into the security failures at the hospital that add to the woes of staff and patients. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Health, 8 March 2022

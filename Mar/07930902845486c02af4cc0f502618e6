DA adopts Energy, Housing and Immigration positions 1 March 2022 Yesterday, during an extended Federal Council Meeting the DA discussed and adopted three crucial policy position papers: Energy and Electricity, Housing, and Migration. The DA Federal Council is the apex governing and policy-making body of the DA and we are pleased that the process to discuss and adopt these positions has gone smoothly. The DA considers evidence-based policy to be the foundation of good governance and the expansion of opportunities for all. We are proud to be able to add these policy positions to our exisiting policy suite. The draft positions will now be updated to include important insights from the deliberations which took place. They will be made available to the public and media in the weeks to come. Given the deepening energy crisis South Africa is facing, rapid urbanisation, and the scapegoating of foreign nationals by the ANC government and other political parties, the DA will showcase an alternative offer which embraces a sustainable energy transition, unlocks affordable housing at scale, and presents migration as an opportunity instead of a threat. Over the next few weeks, the DA will hold media briefings to unpack each of these three policies. The first briefing will take place early next week and more detail will be shared with the media closer to the time.

DA Calls on the SIU to obtain a preservation order against former NLC chairperson  18 March 2022 Yesterday GroundUp revealed that former National Lotteries Commission (NLC), Alfred Nevuthanda, used funds received by non-profit organisations “to help pay for a lavish R27-million mansion”. Nevuthanda was also the former Chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo province and contributed significantly to their historical fundraising efforts. The story published by GroundUp today confirms that “NPO 2” as referred to by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) in their presentation to the portfolio committee a few weeks ago is in fact prima facie evidence of Nevuthanda’s personal looting of the NLC. ANC comrades have been eating at the lotteries trough for many years now, with the full protection of ANC members of the portfolio committee, all while deserving organisations have been deprived of funding. In 2017, DA Shadow Minister for Trade, Industry and Competition, Dean Macpherson vigorously opposed his reappointment on the basis that he had a “well-documented, scandal-ridden” history. Both Minister Patel and the portfolio committee chose to ignore this warning – today he has been vindicated. Considering the evidence at hand, the DA calls on the SIU to approach the Special Tribunal to obtain a preservation order against Nevuthanda as they did against Inqaba Yokulinda and its associates just a month ago. These ill-gotten gains need to be recovered and a historical injustice rectified. Issued by Mat Cuthbert, DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, 18 March 2022

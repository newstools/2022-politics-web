ANC dismisses reports of tax evasion 29 March 2022 The African National Congress (ANC) has noted an article that appeared in one of the online newspaper accusing the organisation of being a "tax evader"and further that the South African Revenue Services (SARC) has issued a 10 day ultimatum for the payment of over 100 million in tax debt. The ANC is neither aware nor informed of such an ultimatum by SARS and therefore dismisses such inaccurate, malicious, dubious and divisive media reports with the contempt they deserve. Matters of taxation of the ANC are private and handled by the Treasurer General's Office (TGO) who engages with SARS from time to time on such affairs. The ANC TGO has on previous occasions entered into legally permissible payment arrangements with SARS to pay-off its arrears. The ANC will continue to pay all taxes and debts owed to SARS, and certainly finds the allegation of tax evasion rendered against the movement, abhorrent and irresponsible.

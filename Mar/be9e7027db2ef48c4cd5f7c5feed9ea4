Senzo Meyiwa: Private Prosecution Unit concerned that recent developments could cause further delays in case 18 March 2022 AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit, who currently has a watching brief on behalf of Ntombifuthi Meyiwa, as well Zama as Nomalanga Meyiwa (respectively the mother and sisters of Senzo Meyiwa, the former murdered Bafana-Bafana captain) in the criminal case following the murder of Senzo, have voiced their concerns that the case that has already been dragging for nearly eight years may now be delayed even further. This follows after four of the five accused on 17 March appointed new counsel, Advocate Malesela Teffo. However, this same advocate also has a watching brief on behalf of Sifiso Meyiwa, Senzo’s brother. Muzikawukhulelwa Sibiya, Bongani Sandiso Ntanzi, Mthobisi Prince Mncube, and Mthokoziseni Maphisa who stand accused of murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, the possession of firearms without a licence and the possession of ammunition, yesterday during pre-trial proceedings indicated that they had changed counsel and that Adv. Teffo would be representing them from now on. He also indicated that the four accused intended to bring a special plea. “The Private Prosecution Unit has been briefed by Senzo’s mother and sisters to ensure that justice is done and we will continue doing just that. However, it is very unusual that the same representative who is acting on behalf of a certain family member, is now also defending some of the accused persons. We agree with the State Advocate, George Baloi, that there is probably a conflict of interest and our main concern is that the sudden change of legal representatives will probably delay the matter even further,” says Adv. Gerrie Nel, Head of AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit. Issued by Carina Bester, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 18 March 2022

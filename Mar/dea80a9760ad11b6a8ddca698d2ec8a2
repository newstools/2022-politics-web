DA welcomes HRC inquiry into NW schools infrastructure  1 March 2022 Note to Editors: Please find the attached soundbite in English by Gavin Edwards. The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the Human Rights Commission (HRC) inquiry hearings to be held from 2 to 4 March 2022 in Mafikeng into inadequate infrastructure at North West schools. The DA lodged complaints with the HRC after conducting oversight at Setshwarapelo Primary in Taung in 2019 and Promosa High School in Potchefstroom in 2020. Dangerous building structures and exposed asbestos pose a severe health risk to teachers and children.  Extensive damage to roofs, walls and floors are a major cause for concern.  Sections of these buildings need to be demolished while the rest need urgent major renovation. The DA has been served with a notice to appear before the inquiry, scheduled for three whole days.  We will abide by the notice as we have been calling for it. The DA North West Provincial Legislature Caucus Leader, Freddy Sonakile (MPL), and Chief Whip, Gavin Edwards (MPL), will attend and will be available for interviews after the inquiry.  We look forward to the Department of Education being taken to task. Education is an issue that is close to our hearts, and the DA will fight tooth and nail against everything that impedes the delivery of quality education.

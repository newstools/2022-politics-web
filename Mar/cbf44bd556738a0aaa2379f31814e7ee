Mayor engages over 100 independent power producers in push to end load-shedding in Cape Town 17 March 2022 I was honoured to welcome more than 100 stakeholders from the independent power producer (IPP) sector to the Cape Town Stadium for an engagement session on the City’s vision to achieve energy security. This was part of our journey towards ending load-shedding in Cape Town. Speaking at the event, I laid out how private sector innovation will be key to securing Cape Town’s energy future, both through increasing the reliability of our electricity supply to end load-shedding and making electricity more affordable for Capetonians and their businesses. I was joined by the Mayoral Committee Member for Energy, Councillor Beverley van Reenen, and the City’s Executive Director for Energy, Mr Kadri Nassiep, who both outlined the City’s medium to long-term vision for an independently-powered, energy secure Cape Town. Mr Nassiep also explained which aspects of this vision are already being actioned, putting Cape Town at the cutting edge of municipal energy independence in South Africa. This included our first round of procurement of power from IPPs, the tendering process for which is ongoing. Stakeholders were then given an opportunity to consult a panel of officials from the City, and also offer their ideas about what the City could do to reach its goal of reliable, affordable and clean energy for all Capetonians, as quickly and sustainably as possible. I look forward to continuing a dialogue with the sector as we work together towards energy security in Cape Town, harnessing the private sector’s innovation and efficiency for public good.

AfriForum’s safety team assists metro police during unrest in Pretoria 16 March 2022 The civil rights organisation AfriForum’s Community Safety Department assisted the Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) today during violent protests in Pretoria. The MEC for community safety in Tshwane, Grandi Theunissen, approached AfriForum for assistance and requested that AfriForum’s air wing deploy its drones to provide time-sensitive information to the TMPD regarding the protesters’ location and activities. AfriForum neighborhood watch members, community policing forums and law enforcers also observed the situation and provided the joint operational center with the necessary information. The safety team’s drones fine combed the Centurion as well as Olievenhoutbosch area and more drones were on standby should the protest spread to other areas. Protesters caused disruption at the Highlands Shopping Center in Centurion and also tried to make their way to the Lyttelton Police Station but due to swift action and co-operation between the various role players, the situation was soon defused. The unrest was caused by municipal workers who went on strike over a wage dispute. “AfriForum has several neighborhood and farm watch teams across the country who regularly join forces with law enforcement authorities. Today’s events have once again proved how effective it can be when law enforcement and community safety structures work together to secure communities and property,” says Jacques Broodryk, AfriForum’s Campaign Manager.

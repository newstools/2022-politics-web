Speaker accedes to DA leader’s request for roll call voting procedure 29 March 2022 The Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, has acceded to a request by the Leader of the Official Opposition, Mr John Steenhuisen, for a roll-call voting procedure during voting on his motion of no confidence in the Cabinet, excluding the President, scheduled for tomorrow, 30 March 2022. According to the Rules on virtual sittings, Members are entitled to cast their votes either electronically, by voice or by having their votes recorded by their respective Whips. In this regard, the Speaker has confirmed that a manual roll-call voting procedure will be used for the voting on the motion. This will entail the question being put for a decision of the House, followed by the Secretary calling each Member, and each Member voicing either "yes" or "no" on the question. The Speaker has since received a belated response from the ATM declining to withdraw its motion instead of postponing it. The motion will therefore remain on tomorrow's agenda of the House as scheduled by the National Assembly's Programme Committee. Issued by Moloto Mothapo, Media Officer, Parliament, 29 March 2022

Imminent end to State of Disaster long overdue, additional regulations unnecessary 30 March 2022 The news that the National State of Disaster will soon fall away is most welcome and is long overdue. I am concerned that many of the restrictions now in place under the Disaster Regulations will be made more permanent under the proposed Health Act regulations. Events, festivals, crowds, tourists, sports matches and businesses are coming back to Cape Town. Cape Town is also among the most vaccinated places in the country. There is no sound scientific reason to continue to restrict outdoor gathering sizes, and these restrictions only hold back the economic recovery that is so urgently necessary.

SACP welcomes public release of State Capture Inquiry Report Part 3 Volumes  4 March 2022 The South African Communist Party (SACP) welcomes President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to publicly release the four volumes of the third part of the report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector. Dismantling state capture networks and rooting out the scourge of corruption, both in the public and private sector, is a crucial national imperative in defence of our democracy, to move the national democratic revolution into a second radical phase, advance and deepen it. The SACP will strengthen its efforts to build a widest possible patriotic front and a popular Left front, with dismantling state capture, ending crime and corruption as part of their strategic objectives. In the same vein, the SACP will produce a comprehensive response to the complete report of the commission from the first to the last part, inclusive of their respective volumes.

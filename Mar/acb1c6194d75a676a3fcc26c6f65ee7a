ActionSA Elects New Caucus Leader in City of Johannesburg 22 March 2022 Today, 22 March 2022, the ActionSA Caucus in Johannesburg met and elected Councillor Funzi Ngobeni was elected as the Caucus Leader. The need for such an election arose from the departure of Herman Mashaba from Council in a decision taken to focus on the 2024 campaign and afford others the opportunity and experience to serve in Johannesburg. Councillor Ngobeni has served as an MMC of Development Planning and Finance at different times in the 2016 term of office and currently serves as the MMC of Transport. He has a track record in both the public and private sector and is a dedicated civil servant. ActionSA is confident that Councillor Ngobeni will lead the ActionSA Caucus effectively and ethically. He will work to ensure that our Councillors participate within the coalition in Johannesburg in such a manner that it is the residents of Johannesburg who are served and not political parties.

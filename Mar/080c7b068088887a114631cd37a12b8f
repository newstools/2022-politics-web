DA calls on StatsSA to provide an update on the delayed release of unemployment statistics 14 March 2022 The DA is calling on Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) to provide an update on the delayed release of the 2021 fourth-quarter Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) statistics which were due for release on 21 February 2022. When StatsSA announced their decision to delay the release of the QLFS, they cited a 'slow response rate' and the need to do 'quality checks' before the results could be made public. While the DA does not dispute the necessity of quality assurance checks to ensure validity of the data, almost three weeks have passed with no status update from StatsSA on how this process is unfolding. The QLFS is an important statistical output that provides insight into South Africa's labour market by breaking down the employment/unemployment trends across the country's various economic sectors. It provides South Africans with an opportunity to ascertain whether the country is on the right track or not in addressing the scourge of unemployment. According to the third quarter 2021 QLFS statistics released in November, South Africa's expanded unemployment rate increased to 46,6%, the highest since the start of the QLFS in 2008. More than anything, the unemployment crisis in South Africa has become a national disaster with far-reaching consequences for the country's socio-economic stability. Unless urgent measures are taken to revive the economy, liberalise the labour market and foster an environment conducive to job creation, the joblessness crisis will only get worse. StatsSA should continue to play its part and ensure that all statistical outputs, including the QLFS, are released on time. It is for this reason that we are looking forward to an urgent update from StatsSA on when the 2021 fourth-quarter QLFS statistics will be released.

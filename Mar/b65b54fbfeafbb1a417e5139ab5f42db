The ANC government must clarify its stance on Russia 2 March 2022 Note to Editors: Please find an attached soundbite by Darren Bergman MP Yesterday, the DA in a member's statement in Parliament called on the minister of international relations, Naledi Pandor, to clarify the South African government's stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Will the ANC government be condemning Russia and will they be joining the rest of the world in calling for the withdrawal of Russia from Ukraine and to impose sanctions on Russia? There have been several calls for South Africa to use its position in BRICS and proximity to President Vladimir Putin to de-escalate the rising tensions that have been advancing since at least 2014. This has been an opportune time for the ANC to reclaim lost space in the international arena by making some positive gains from a series of blaring blusters. Today, South Africa will be holding a seat for an important vote in the UN General Assembly and an abstention or vote with Russia will be a show of support for the continuation of the invasion of Ukraine. The Minister needs to take South Africa into her confidence and give us the assurance that our ambassador will be supporting the resolution against Russia. This is not the time to be loyal to war hungry allies. It’s the time to do it what is just and right Issued by Darren Bergman, DA Shadow Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, 2 March 2022

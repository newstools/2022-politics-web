Support DA Motion of No Confidence in Minister Dlamini-Zuma 15 March 2022 Note to Editors: Please find attached English and Afrikaans soundbites by Cilliers Brink MP. The DA takes note that the State of Disaster and Covid-19 lockdown have been extended yet again. This, despite the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic in its current form no longer conforms to any reasonable definition of ‘disaster’, and scientist in South Africa and abroad have called for lockdown restrictions to be lifted. The DA believes that this move from the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, is nothing but a power grab in order continue to give ANC cronies and comrades easy access to Covid-funds, and to trample upon fundamental Constitutional rights. Yet again, the decision to extend the State of Disaster was done without proper consultation with experts or the President’s Coordinating Council (PCC), no explanation to the public and zero accountability to Parliament. It is time Minister Dlamini-Zuma was fired. Her brand of irrational dictatorship is eroding the economy and causing job losses on a massive scale. Almost 10 000 South Africans have already shown their support for the DA’s Motion of No Confidence by signing our petition. South Africa simply cannot afford to have incompetent Ministers at the steer. Issued by Cilliers Brink, DA Shadow Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, 15 March 2022

Disastrous theft delays opening of Charlotte Maxeke Hospital casualty 7 March 2022 It is most distressing that yet another major theft at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital (CMJH) is delaying the re-opening of the casualty unit which was due to happen on 14 March. Despite R40 million a year spent on hospital security, there has been theft of copper pipes, and more than 500 metres of electrical cable and new electrical distribution boards. This follows the theft last year of R30 million of copper pipes after the fire on 16 April that forced the closure of the hospital. How is it possible that major thefts continue to occur at this hospital? The effect of this latest theft is disastrous as other hospitals are unable to cope with casualty patients that should be treated at CMJH. Helen Joseph Hospital is at breaking point with exhausted staff and patients spending days in corridors before being admitted to a ward. The security company should be fired, and an investigation done as to whether this was an inside job. The Democratic Alliance will continue to pressure the provincial government to fix the continuing calamity in the Gauteng Health Department which inflicts enormous suffering on sick and injured people in our public health facilities.
